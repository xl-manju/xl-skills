+Skills extend what Claude can do. Create a

+Create a skill when you keep pasting the same instructions, checklist, or multi-step procedure into chat, or when a section of CLAUDE.md has grown into a procedure rather than a fact. Unlike CLAUDE.md content, a skill’s body loads only when it’s used, so long reference material costs almost nothing until you need it.
