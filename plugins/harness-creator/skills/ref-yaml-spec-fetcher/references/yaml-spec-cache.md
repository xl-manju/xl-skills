Skip to main content
Skills extend what Claude can do. Create a
SKILL.md
file with instructions, and Claude adds it to its toolkit. Claude uses skills when relevant, or you can invoke one directly with
/skill-name
.
Create a skill when you keep pasting the same instructions, checklist, or multi-step procedure into chat, or when a section of CLAUDE.md has grown into a procedure rather than a fact. Unlike CLAUDE.md content, a skill’s body loads only when it’s used, so long reference material costs almost nothing until you need it.
For built-in commands like
/help
and
/compact
, and bundled skills like
/debug
and
/code-review
, see the
commands reference
.
Custom commands have been merged into skills.
A file at
.claude/commands/deploy.md
and a skill at
.claude/skills/deploy/SKILL.md
both create
/deploy
and work the same way. Your existing
.claude/commands/
files keep working. Skills add optional features: a directory for supporting files, frontmatter to
control whether you or Claude invokes them
, and the ability for Claude to load them automatically when relevant.
Claude Code skills follow the
Agent Skills
open standard, which works across multiple AI tools. Claude Code extends the standard with additional features like
invocation control
,
subagent execution
, and
dynamic context injection
. See
Using skill frontmatter outside Claude Code
for which frontmatter fields are part of the standard and which are Claude Code extensions.
​
Bundled skills
Claude Code includes a set of bundled skills, such as
/doctor
,
/code-review
,
/batch
,
/debug
,
/loop
, and
/claude-api
. Bundled skills are prompt-based: they give Claude detailed instructions and let it orchestrate the work using its tools. Most built-in commands instead execute fixed logic directly.
You invoke a bundled skill the same way as any other skill, by typing
/
followed by the skill name. Claude invokes some bundled skills automatically when relevant; others, including
/verify
, run only when you invoke them, which keeps you in control of when these longer-running checks spend time and tokens.
Most bundled skills are available in every session. A few depend on a specific feature:
/workflow-authoring
, for example, is available only when
dynamic workflows
are enabled.
To turn bundled skills off, use the
disableBundledSkills
setting.
The
/doctor
setup checkup stays typable when
disableBundledSkills
is on, in Claude Code v2.1.205 and later. To hide it, set the
DISABLE_DOCTOR_COMMAND
environment variable or a
skillOverrides
entry of
"doctor": "off"
. Before v2.1.205,
/doctor
was a built-in command rather than a bundled skill.
Bundled skills are listed alongside built-in commands in the
commands reference
, marked
Skill
in the Purpose column.
​
Run and verify your app
Three bundled skills work together to launch your app and confirm changes against the running app instead of just tests:
Skill
Purpose
/run
Launch and drive your app to see a change working
/verify
Build and run your app to confirm a code change does what it should, without falling back to tests or type checks
/run-skill-generator
Teach
/run
and
/verify
how to build and launch your project
/run
and
/verify
work without setup. They infer the launch from your project type (CLI, server, TUI, browser-driven) and from what’s in your README,
package.json
, or
Makefile
. That inference gets unreliable for projects that need anything beyond a standard launch: a database, an env file, a graphical session, a multi-step build.
/run-skill-generator
records the recipe instead. It gets your app running from a clean environment, captures what worked (the install commands, the env vars, the launch script), and commits it as a per-project skill at
.claude/skills/run-<name>/
. After that,
/run
,
/verify
, and any other agent in the repo follow the recorded recipe instead of rediscovering it. Run
/run-skill-generator
once per project, and again if the build or launch process changes.
/verify
can also record its own recipe. When it has to build and drive your app without a recorded recipe, it writes what worked to
.claude/skills/verify/SKILL.md
at the repo root, or in the touched package directory in a monorepo, so later runs and other agents follow the same steps. At the repo root, the recorded skill replaces the bundled
/verify
. This requires Claude Code v2.1.200 or later.
Claude edits the recorded file only when it steered a run wrong, such as a command that failed or a missing step, so you can commit the file without per-session diffs. Before v2.1.205, the bundled skill told Claude to fold in anything a run learned, which caused frequent merge conflicts.
​
Getting started
​
Create your first skill
This example creates a skill that summarizes the uncommitted changes in your git repository and flags anything risky. It pulls the live diff into the prompt before Claude reads it, so the response is grounded in your actual working tree rather than what Claude can guess from open files. Claude loads the skill automatically when you ask about your changes, or you can invoke it directly with
/summarize-changes
.
1
Create the skill directory
Create a directory for the skill in your personal skills folder. Personal skills are available across all your projects.
mkdir
-p
~/.claude/skills/summarize-changes
2
Write SKILL.md
Every skill needs a
SKILL.md
file with two parts: YAML frontmatter between
---
markers that tells Claude when to use the skill, and markdown content with the instructions Claude follows when the skill runs. The directory name becomes the command you type, and the
description
helps Claude decide when to load the skill automatically.
Save this to
~/.claude/skills/summarize-changes/SKILL.md
:
---
description
:
Summarizes uncommitted changes and flags anything risky. Use when the user asks what changed, wants a commit message, or asks to review their diff.
---
## Current changes
!`git
diff HEAD`
## Instructions
Summarize the changes above in two or three bullet points, then list any risks you notice such as missing error handling, hardcoded values, or tests that need updating. If the diff is empty, say there are no uncommitted changes.
The
!`git diff HEAD`
line uses
dynamic context injection
: Claude Code runs the command and replaces the line with its output before Claude sees the skill content, so the instructions arrive with the current diff already inlined.
3
Test the skill
Open a git project, make a small edit to any file, and start Claude Code by running
claude
. You can test the skill two ways.
Let Claude invoke it automatically
by asking something that matches the description:
What did I change?
Or invoke it directly
with the skill name:
/summarize-changes
Either way, Claude should respond with a short summary of your edit and a list of risks.
​
Choose where skills load
Where you save a skill decides which sessions load it. Save it under your home directory to get it in every project, commit it to a repository to share it with everyone who works there, or distribute it through a plugin or managed settings to reach a whole team.
Location
Path
Loads in
Enterprise
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
in the
managed settings directory
All users on machines where your organization deploys it
Personal
~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
All your projects on this machine, but not
Cowork or cloud sessions
Project
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
Sessions in this repository. Commit it so your team gets it too
Nested
<subdir>/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
Sessions started in or below
<subdir>
. A session started above it loads the skill once Claude works on files there. See
monorepos and subdirectories
Additional directory
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
in a directory you pass with
--add-dir
That session. See
directories outside the project
Plugin
<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
Wherever the
plugin
is enabled, as
/plugin-name:skill-name
claude.ai account
Skills enabled for your claude.ai account
Cowork sessions, cloud sessions, and terminal sessions where you sign in with that account. See
Skills synced from claude.ai
Skill folders also follow these rules:
Symlinked folders
: a
<skill-name>
entry in the enterprise, personal, or project location can be a symlink to a directory elsewhere on disk. Claude Code reads
SKILL.md
from the target and loads the skill once even if several locations point at the same target. Plugin skills
handle symlinks differently
.
Reserved name
: don’t name a skill folder
synced
, in any capitalization. Claude Code uses
~/.claude/skills/synced/
for
skills downloaded from claude.ai
and skips a skill you author at that name in the enterprise, personal, and project locations.
Command files
: a Markdown file in
.claude/commands/
is the older format and still works. It supports the same
frontmatter
except
name
and
paths
. To find the name you type to invoke it, see
How a skill gets its command name
. Prefer a skill for new work, since skills also support
supporting files
.
Skill folder as a plugin
: add a
.claude-plugin/plugin.json
to a skill folder and it loads as a
plugin
named
<name>@skills-dir
, so it can bundle agents, hooks, and MCP servers. In a project’s
.claude/skills/
, this requires accepting the workspace trust dialog first.
​
Load skills in monorepos and subdirectories
Claude Code loads project skills from
.claude/skills/
in the directory where you start it and in every parent directory up to the repository root, so starting in
packages/frontend/
still picks up skills defined at the root. When you
move the session with
/cd
on v2.1.246 or later, Claude Code adds the new directory’s project skills.
Skills in a
.claude/skills/
directory below where you started don’t load at startup. They load the first time Claude reads or edits a file in that subdirectory and stay available for the rest of the session. Until then they don’t appear in the
/
menu and you can’t invoke them by name. To load them sooner, run
/add-dir
with the subdirectory’s path, which requires Claude Code v2.1.257 or later.
When a nested skill shares a name with another skill, both stay available. With a
deploy
skill at the repository root and another in
apps/web/.claude/skills/
:
/deploy
runs the root skill. Claude Code also lists the directory-qualified variants for Claude, with an instruction to invoke the one whose directory holds the files it’s working on, so the nested skill still applies to work in
apps/web/
.
/apps/web:deploy
runs the nested skill on its own. Its description names the directory it applies to.
​
Load skills from a directory outside the project
When you add a directory with
--add-dir
or
/add-dir
, Claude Code loads the skills in that directory’s
.claude/skills/
, along with its
.claude/commands/
and
.claude/agents/
. Directories the Agent SDK adds through
additionalDirectories
in TypeScript or
add_dirs
in Python load the same way, because the SDK passes them as
--add-dir
. The
permissions.additionalDirectories
setting in
settings.json
grants file access only and loads none of these.
Claude Code watches
.claude/skills/
in a directory you pass with
--add-dir
at launch, as
Edit a skill during a session
describes. It doesn’t watch the added directory’s
.claude/commands/
or
.claude/agents/
, so restart the session after changing a file there.
These loads depend on the
project
setting source
, which is on by default. A
strictPluginOnlyCustomization
policy,
bare mode
, and
--safe-mode
each restrict them further, as those pages describe. See
Additional directories grant file access, not configuration
for the full table of what an added directory loads, including
CLAUDE.md
and plugin settings.
​
Resolve skills that share a name
When two skills share a name, where each one came from decides which one
/name
runs. The table covers the enterprise, personal, project, nested, plugin, and claude.ai locations, bundled skills, and command files:
Same name in
Which one runs
Two of enterprise, personal, and project
Enterprise over personal, and personal over project. With
deploy
in both
~/.claude/skills/
and the project’s
.claude/skills/
,
/deploy
runs the personal one
Any of those locations and a
bundled skill
Your skill replaces the bundled command, but not its aliases. A project
code-review
skill replaces
/code-review
, and the bundled alias
/review
never runs your skill
A skill and a file in
.claude/commands/
The skill
A project-root skill and a nested skill
Both load. See
monorepos and subdirectories
A plugin skill and a skill at any of the locations above
Both load, because plugin skills are namespaced as
/plugin-name:skill-name
Any of the above and a skill
synced from your claude.ai account
The other skill or command. The synced skill still runs as
/anthropic-skills:<name>
. See
When a synced skill name matches another command
​
Use skills in Cowork and cloud sessions
Cowork
sessions and
cloud sessions
, including
routines
, don’t read
~/.claude/skills/
on your machine. Both interactive and scheduled Cowork sessions load the skills enabled for your claude.ai account, synced at session start; manage them from
Customize
in the Desktop app sidebar or from the skills settings on claude.ai. Cloud sessions additionally load project skills committed to the cloned repository’s
.claude/skills/
.
If a skill exists only in
~/.claude/skills/
on your machine, Claude Code reports that the skill was not found when a
routine
invokes it, because each routine run starts as a fresh cloud session. To make a personal skill available in these sessions:
For Cowork and cloud sessions, enable the skill for your claude.ai account.
For cloud sessions, you can instead commit the skill to the repository’s
.claude/skills/
, or ship it in a plugin declared in the repository’s
.claude/settings.json
. Repo-declared plugins
install at session start
; plugins enabled only in your user settings don’t transfer.
Desktop scheduled tasks
run locally on your machine, so they do load
~/.claude/skills/
.
​
Skills synced from claude.ai
This section applies to you if you use Cowork or cloud sessions, or sign in to Claude Code in your terminal with a claude.ai account. In those sessions, Claude Code loads the skills enabled for your claude.ai account, with no setup on your part, as
Where synced skills load
describes. Those skills include the ones you create or turn on in your claude.ai settings, skills your organization provides there, and Anthropic’s built-in skills such as
pdf
and
xlsx
.
Claude Code downloads a synced skill from your account rather than reading a file you wrote on the machine where the session runs, so it applies rules to synced skills that don’t apply to the skills you store in the
skills locations
.
​
Where synced skills load
In a Cowork or cloud session, Claude Code loads the skills enabled for your claude.ai account, and
Skills in Cowork and cloud sessions
says how to choose which skills those sessions get.
In your terminal, Claude Code syncs those skills in sessions where you sign in with your claude.ai account. When the session starts, Claude Code downloads your account’s skills into
~/.claude/skills/synced/
in the background, then checks claude.ai for changes about every 10 minutes while the session runs. When a check finds that a skill was added, edited, or turned off on claude.ai, Claude Code adds, updates, or removes it in the running session without a restart. Syncing in terminal sessions requires Claude Code v2.1.273 or later.
The sync never delays startup, because Claude waits for a skill’s download only when it invokes that skill. A short
non-interactive
run can therefore finish before a newly added skill downloads, in which case a later session downloads it. To make a non-interactive run download your skills and wait for the list before it answers the prompt, set
CLAUDE_CODE_SYNC_SKILLS
to
1
.
Claude Code syncs only in a session that signs in with your claude.ai account and
fetches feature flags from Anthropic
. It doesn’t sync in these sessions:
A session that doesn’t use a sign-in stored by
/login
, such as one that authenticates with an API key, or one where
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN
,
CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN
, or an
apiKeyHelper
script supplies the credential
A session that doesn’t fetch feature flags, such as one on Amazon Bedrock or one where you set
CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC
A session in
bare mode
or one you start with
--safe-mode
A session where your organization’s managed settings
lock skills to plugin sources
, or one you start with a
--setting-sources
list that leaves out
user
If you sign in with
/login
during a session, restart Claude Code to start syncing.
Skills that an earlier session synced stay on disk. Claude Code loads them in later sessions signed in to the same account, even when it can’t reach claude.ai.
To see which skills synced, run
/skills
. The menu lists them under
claude.ai sync
.
Some of Anthropic’s skills, such as
pdf
and
xlsx
, always sync. For the rest, turn a skill on or off in your skills settings on claude.ai to change whether it syncs.
To stop syncing on a machine, set
syncClaudeAiSkills
to
false
in your user settings. Claude Code stops downloading, and the next time it starts it moves the skills it already synced to
~/.claude/skills/.trash/
and no longer loads them. Your organization can turn syncing off for everyone by turning off Skills on claude.ai. To stop syncing while leaving Skills on, it can set the same key in
managed settings
.
If your organization turns Skills off on claude.ai, Claude Code removes the downloaded skills and they stop loading. The removed skills move to
~/.claude/skills/.trash/
, where you can recover the files until the
retention sweep
deletes them. Once your organization turns Skills back on, Claude Code downloads the skills you enabled at the next sync.
​
When a synced skill name matches another command
You can invoke a synced skill by its full name,
/anthropic-skills:<name>
, or by its short name,
/<name>
. When another command uses that short name,
/<name>
runs the other command, and the synced skill runs only as
/anthropic-skills:<name>
. With a local
deploy
skill and a synced
deploy
,
/deploy
runs the local skill and
/anthropic-skills:deploy
runs the synced one. Before v2.1.269, a synced skill had only its short name.
The other command can be any of these:
A built-in command or a
bundled skill
, including one that’s unavailable in your session, for example after you turn bundled skills off
A skill at any
local level
or a file in
.claude/commands/
A plugin skill
An
MCP prompt
Claude Code labels synced skills so you can tell where they came from. The
/skills
menu and
/context
group synced skills under
claude.ai sync
, and the
/
command menu marks them as coming from claude.ai.
When it compares names, Claude Code ignores case, spacing, and invisible characters, and treats compatibility forms such as fullwidth letters and dash variants as their plain equivalents. For example, a synced skill named
Commit
and a local skill named
commit
count as the same name, so
/commit
keeps running your local skill.
A name that differs only by a look-alike letter from another alphabet counts as a different name, and the
claude.ai sync
label is how you tell the two apart. These checks and labels require Claude Code v2.1.228 or later.
​
How Claude Code handles the frontmatter of a synced skill
Claude Code applies two rules to a synced skill’s frontmatter:
Claude Code honors the frontmatter in every kind of session, so an
allowed-tools
grant goes through the normal
permission flow
.
Claude Code sanitizes the display text the skill supplies, such as its description. It removes control characters, and in text that reaches Claude, such as the description, it also escapes angle brackets so the text can’t imitate Claude Code’s internal formatting. This sanitization requires Claude Code v2.1.228 or later.
​
How Claude Code handles the body of a synced skill
What Claude Code does with a synced skill’s body depends on where the session runs:
In a cloud session, the body keeps the behavior a local skill has, because the session runs in an isolated container.
In a Cowork session on your desktop, the body keeps the behavior a local skill has, except that Claude Code replaces every
!
command line with the
disableSkillShellExecution
placeholder
, as it does for every skill you supply there.
In any other session on your machine, Claude Code doesn’t run
!
commands
, doesn’t attach the files that
@
references name the way it does for a local skill, and doesn’t substitute the
${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}
and
${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}
placeholders, so the
@
references and both placeholders reach Claude as literal text. A
!
command line reaches Claude as literal text too, or as that placeholder when
disableSkillShellExecution
is on. This handling requires Claude Code v2.1.228 or later.
​
Edit a skill during a session
Claude Code watches skill directories for file changes, except in
bare mode
. When you add, edit, or remove a skill under
~/.claude/skills/
, the project
.claude/skills/
, or a
.claude/skills/
inside an
--add-dir
directory, Claude Code picks up the change within the current session, without a restart. If you create a top-level skills directory that didn’t exist when the session started, restart Claude Code so it can watch the new directory.
Live change detection covers
SKILL.md
text only. For a skill folder that is also a
plugin
, changes to
hooks/
,
.mcp.json
,
agents/
, and
output-styles/
need
/reload-plugins
to take effect.
​
Remove a skill
How you remove a skill depends on where it came from:
Personal or project skill
: delete the skill’s directory,
~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
or
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
. Claude Code
drops it from
/skills
in the current session
; content Claude Code already loaded from it follows the
skill content lifecycle
.
Enterprise skill
: an administrator deletes the skill’s directory from
.claude/skills/
inside the
managed settings directory
, for example
/etc/claude-code/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
on Linux.
Plugin skill
: disable or uninstall the plugin that provides it, from the
/plugin
menu or with
/plugin uninstall <plugin-name>@<marketplace-name>
. Claude Code unloads the plugin’s skills when
the change applies
or when you restart.
Skill synced from claude.ai
: turn the skill off for your claude.ai account, in the same place you
enabled it
. Claude Code removes it from
~/.claude/skills/synced/
the next time it
syncs your skills
. If you delete the directory by hand instead, the next sync downloads it again while the skill stays enabled on claude.ai.
Bundled skill
: set
disableBundledSkills
to
true
to turn off bundled skills, or set one skill to
"off"
in
skillOverrides
to hide it.
To keep a personal or project skill but stop Claude from invoking it on its own, set
disable-model-invocation: true
in its frontmatter, or
"user-invocable-only"
in
skillOverrides
when you don’t want to edit the file.
​
Configure skills
Skills are configured through YAML frontmatter at the top of
SKILL.md
and the markdown content that follows.
​
Types of skill content
Skill files can contain any instructions, but thinking about how you want to invoke them helps guide what to include:
Reference content
adds knowledge Claude applies to your current work. Conventions, patterns, style guides, domain knowledge. This content runs inline so Claude can use it alongside your conversation context.
---
name
:
api-conventions
description
:
API design patterns for this codebase
---
When writing API endpoints
:
-
Use RESTful naming conventions
-
Return consistent error formats
-
Include request validation
Task content
gives Claude step-by-step instructions for a specific action, like deployments, commits, or code generation. These are often actions you want to invoke directly with
/skill-name
rather than letting Claude decide when to run them. Add
disable-model-invocation: true
to prevent Claude from triggering it automatically. The example below adds
context: fork
, which runs the skill in its own subagent context; see
Run skills in a subagent
.
---
name
:
deploy
description
:
Deploy the application to production
context
:
fork
disable-model-invocation
:
true
---
Deploy the application
:
1. Run the test suite
2. Build the application
3. Push to the deployment target
Keep the body itself concise. Once a skill loads, its content
stays in context across turns
, so every line is a recurring token cost. State what to do rather than narrating how or why, and apply the same conciseness test you would for
CLAUDE.md content
.
​
Frontmatter reference
Beyond the markdown content, you can configure skill behavior using YAML frontmatter fields between
---
markers at the top of your
SKILL.md
file:
---
name
:
my-skill
description
:
What this skill does
disable-model-invocation
:
true
allowed-tools
:
Read Grep
---
Your skill instructions here...
All fields are optional. Only
description
is recommended so Claude knows when to use the skill.
Claude Code reads the frontmatter only when the opening
---
is the file’s first line. Otherwise it treats the whole file,
---
markers included, as skill content.
Boolean fields accept
yes
,
no
,
on
,
off
,
1
, and
0
in any letter case, in addition to
true
and
false
. Before v2.1.218, Claude Code recognized only
true
and
false
.
Field
Required
Description
name
No
Display name shown in skill listings. Defaults to the directory name. See
How a skill gets its command name
for how the field interacts with the name you type to invoke the skill.
description
Recommended
What the skill does and when to use it. Claude uses this to decide when to apply the skill. If omitted, uses the first non-empty line of the markdown content. Put the key use case first: the combined
description
and
when_to_use
text is truncated at 1,536 characters in the skill listing to reduce context usage.
when_to_use
No
Additional context for when Claude should invoke the skill, such as trigger phrases or example requests. Appended to
description
in the skill listing and counts toward the 1,536-character cap.
argument-hint
No
Hint shown during autocomplete to indicate expected arguments. Example:
[issue-number]
or
[filename] [format]
.
arguments
No
Named positional arguments for
$name
substitution
in the skill content. Accepts a space-separated string or a YAML list. Names map to argument positions in order.
disable-model-invocation
No
Set to
true
to prevent Claude from automatically loading this skill. Use for workflows you want to trigger manually with
/name
. Also prevents the skill from being
preloaded into subagents
. As of v2.1.196, also prevents the skill from running when a
scheduled task
fires with the skill as its prompt. Default:
false
.
user-invocable
No
Set to
false
when only Claude should invoke the skill: Claude Code hides it from the
/
menu and doesn’t run it when you type
/name
. Use for background knowledge users shouldn’t invoke directly. Default:
true
.
allowed-tools
No
Tools Claude can use without asking permission during the turn that invokes this skill. The grant clears when you send your next message. Accepts a space- or comma-separated string, or a YAML list. See
Pre-approve tools for a skill
.
disallowed-tools
No
Tools removed from Claude’s available pool while this skill is active. Use for autonomous skills that should never call certain tools, such as
AskUserQuestion
for a background loop. Accepts a space- or comma-separated string, or a YAML list. The restriction clears when you send your next message. Like deny rules, the field can’t remove
EndConversation
while any other tool remains.
model
No
Model to use when this skill is active. The override applies for the rest of the current turn and isn’t saved to settings. The session model resumes when you send your next prompt. Accepts the same values as
/model
, or
inherit
to keep the active model. A value excluded by your organization’s
availableModels
allowlist isn’t used, and the session keeps its current model. In
auto mode
, and in
plan mode while the classifier reviews commands
, a model that auto mode doesn’t support also isn’t used, and the session keeps its current model. With
context: fork
, the value sets the
forked subagent’s model
instead, and an excluded value follows the
same rules as a subagent model override
.
effort
No
Effort level
when this skill is active. Overrides the session effort level. Default: inherits from session. Options:
low
,
medium
,
high
,
xhigh
,
max
; available levels depend on the model.
context
No
Set to
fork
to run in a forked subagent context. See
Run skills in a subagent
.
agent
No
Which subagent type to use when
context: fork
is set.
background
No
Only applies with
context: fork
. Set to
false
to wait for the forked subagent’s result in the turn that invoked the skill, instead of
running it in the background
. Default:
true
. Requires Claude Code v2.1.218 or later.
hooks
No
Hooks that Claude Code registers when the skill is invoked and keeps running for the rest of the session. See
Hooks in skills and agents
for the configuration format and the
once
option.
paths
No
Glob patterns that limit when this skill is activated. Accepts a comma-separated string or a YAML list. When set, Claude loads the skill automatically only when working with files matching the patterns. Uses the same format as
path-specific rules
.
shell
No
Shell to use for
!`command`
and
```!
blocks in this skill. Accepts
bash
(default) or
powershell
. Setting
powershell
runs inline shell commands via PowerShell when the
PowerShell tool
is enabled: it’s on by default on Windows without Git Bash, on by default with Git Bash for claude.ai and Console accounts, and needs
CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL=1
in Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud’s Agent Platform, and Microsoft Foundry sessions and on macOS, Linux, and WSL. Set it to
0
to turn the tool off.
metadata
No
Free-form YAML map for your own key-value data, such as entitlement or catalog fields, read by your own tooling from
SKILL.md
. Claude Code doesn’t act on its contents, and drops a value that isn’t a map. Don’t reuse frontmatter field names such as
paths
as keys.
license
No
License covering the skill. Part of the
Agent Skills
spec; see
Using skill frontmatter outside Claude Code
. Claude Code accepts the field but doesn’t act on it.
compatibility
No
Environment requirements for the skill, such as intended products or system prerequisites, as defined by the
Agent Skills
spec; see
Using skill frontmatter outside Claude Code
. Accepts a string of up to 500 characters. Claude Code accepts the field but doesn’t act on it.
​
Using skill frontmatter outside Claude Code
Claude Code accepts every field in the table above. Outside Claude Code, you can use only the fields in the
Agent Skills
spec:
Distribution path
Frontmatter fields you can use
Claude Code skills at
any level
, including
plugin

Every field in the table above
claude.ai skill uploads, the Skills API, and packaging with
package_skill.py
from
anthropics/skills
name
,

,
license
,
compatibility
,
metadata
,
allowed-tools
When you enable a personal skill for your claude.ai account, for example to use it in
Cowork and cloud sessions
and routines, you upload it to claude.ai, so the same rules apply.
If you include any field the spec doesn’t allow, packaging or upload fails with a hard error instead of ignoring the field:
Unexpected key(s) in SKILL.md frontmatter: argument-hint. Allowed properties are: allowed-tools, compatibility, description, license, metadata, name
Restricting frontmatter to the spec’s six fields avoids the unexpected-key error above. The
Agent Skills spec
and the
Skills API requirements
define everything else those paths validate. Claude Code-only body features, such as
dynamic context injection
, don’t function in claude.ai chat or through the API. Claude Code accepts all six fields, so frontmatter that follows the spec loads in Claude Code without changes.
​
How a skill gets its command name
The command you type to invoke a skill comes from where the skill file lives and, for plugin skills, also from the frontmatter
name
field. In a personal or project skill,
name
sets only the display label shown in skill listings, and the command still comes from the directory name. In a plugin skill,
name
sets the last segment of the command and the plugin prefix stays in place.
The table below shows where the command name comes from for each layout:
Skill location
Command name source
Example
Skill directory under
~/.claude/skills/
or
.claude/skills/
Directory name
.claude/skills/deploy-staging/SKILL.md
→
/deploy-staging
Nested
.claude/skills/
directory, when the name clashes with another skill
Subdirectory path relative to the working directory, then the skill directory name
apps/web/.claude/skills/deploy/SKILL.md
→
/apps/web:deploy
File under
.claude/commands/
File name without extension
.claude/commands/deploy.md
→
/deploy
File in a subdirectory of
.claude/commands/
Subdirectory path relative to
commands/
with each
/
replaced by
:
, then the file name without extension
.claude/commands/frontend/component.md
→
/frontend:component
Plugin
skills/
subdirectory
Frontmatter
name
or the directory name, namespaced by plugin
my-plugin/skills/review/SKILL.md
→
/my-plugin:review
, or
/my-plugin:fancy
with
name: fancy
Plugin root
SKILL.md
Frontmatter
name
, with the plugin directory name as a fallback
my-plugin/SKILL.md
with
name: review
→
/my-plugin:review
. See
Path behavior rules
Skill
synced from claude.ai
The skill’s name on your claude.ai account, prefixed with
anthropic-skills:
Account skill
deploy
→
/anthropic-skills:deploy
, or
/deploy
while no other command uses that name
In a plugin skill, the frontmatter
name
replaces the directory name in the last segment of the command, so
my-plugin/skills/review/SKILL.md
with
name: fancy
becomes
/my-plugin:fancy
. The bare
/fancy
also invokes the skill unless another command already uses that name. If the
name
you write already starts with the plugin’s own prefix, Claude Code doesn’t add the prefix again on v2.1.246 or later. For example,
name: my-plugin:fancy
still becomes
/my-plugin:fancy
. From v2.1.216 through v2.1.245, Claude Code doubled the prefix when the
name
already carried it.
In
non-interactive sessions
, the names
help
and
feedback
aren’t reserved for their terminal-only built-in commands, so a plugin skill with one of those names keeps its bare command there. Every other terminal-only built-in’s name, such as
/login
, stays reserved even though the command can’t run in those sessions.
For a plugin-root
SKILL.md
, there is no skill directory to take the name from, so
name
supplies the whole final segment. Without a
name
field, Claude Code falls back to the plugin’s directory name.
​
Available string substitutions
Skills support string substitution for dynamic values in the skill content:
Variable
Description
$ARGUMENTS
All arguments passed when invoking the skill. When no placeholder receives an argument, Claude Code appends them as
ARGUMENTS: <value>
. See
Pass arguments to skills
.
$ARGUMENTS[N]
Access a specific argument by 0-based index, such as
$ARGUMENTS[0]
for the first argument.
$N
Shorthand for
$ARGUMENTS[N]
, such as
$0
for the first argument or
$1
for the second.
$name
Named argument declared in the
arguments
frontmatter list. Names map to positions in order, so with
arguments: [issue, branch]
the placeholder
$issue
expands to the first argument and
$branch
to the second.
${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}
The current session ID. Useful for logging, creating session-specific files, or correlating skill output with sessions.
${CLAUDE_EFFORT}
The current effort level:
low
,
medium
,
high
,
xhigh
, or
max
. Ultracode is not a distinct level and reports as
xhigh
. Use this to adapt skill instructions to the active effort setting.
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}
The directory containing the skill’s
SKILL.md
file. For plugin skills, this is the skill’s subdirectory within the plugin, not the plugin root. Use this in bash injection commands to reference scripts or files bundled with the skill, regardless of the current working directory.
${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}
The project root directory. This is the same path
hooks
and MCP servers receive as
CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
. Use this to reference project-local scripts or files, such as
${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/helper.sh
, independent of where the skill is installed.
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
The plugin’s installation directory. Substituted only in plugin skills. Use this to reference scripts or files bundled anywhere in the plugin, including resources shared between the plugin’s skills. See
plugin environment variables
.
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}
The plugin’s
persistent data directory
, which survives plugin updates. Substituted only in plugin skills. Use this to reference installed dependencies, generated files, or caches that must outlive an update.
Claude Code substitutes
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}
and
${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}
in two places: the skill’s markdown content, and Bash rules in the
allowed-tools
frontmatter. In a plugin skill, Claude Code substitutes
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
and
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}
in the same two places. Using the same variable in both places lets a skill run a bundled script without a permission prompt. The following skill shows the pattern:
---
name
:
render-chart
description
:
Render a chart from a CSV file
allowed-tools
:
Bash(${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/render.sh *)
---
Run `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/render.sh <csv-file>` to render the chart.
If this skill is installed at
~/.claude/skills/render-chart/
, both occurrences of
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}
expand to that directory. The
allowed-tools
rule then matches the exact command the skill body tells Claude to run, so the script runs without prompting.
The
${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}
substitution requires Claude Code v2.1.196 or later.
Indexed arguments use shell-style quoting, so wrap multi-word values in quotes to pass them as a single argument. For example,
/my-skill "hello world" second
makes
$0
expand to
hello world
and
$1
to
second
. The
$ARGUMENTS
placeholder always expands to the full argument string as typed.
An indexed placeholder with no corresponding argument, such as
$2
when only one argument was passed, stays in the content unchanged. A named placeholder from the
arguments
frontmatter with no matching argument expands to an empty string.
If you pass an argument value that itself contains text such as
$1
or
$ARGUMENTS
, Claude Code inserts it as literal text and doesn’t expand it. For example, if a skill’s body contains
Summarize $0
and you run
/summarize "$ARGUMENTS from yesterday"
, Claude receives
Summarize $ARGUMENTS from yesterday
. Claude Code still replaces
${CLAUDE_*}
variables such as
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}
after it inserts the arguments.
To include a literal
$
before a digit,
ARGUMENTS
, or a declared argument name, such as
$1.00
in prose, escape it with a backslash:
\$1.00
. A backslash before any other
$
is left unchanged. Only a single backslash directly before the token escapes it. A doubled backslash such as
\\$1
leaves both backslashes in place, and
$1
still expands to the argument value. The backslash escape covers only these argument placeholders. A backslash doesn’t prevent substitution of a
${CLAUDE_*}
variable where the variable applies.
Example using substitutions:
---
name
:
session-logger
description
:
Log activity for this session
---
Log the following to logs/${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.log
:
$ARGUMENTS
​
Add supporting files
Skills can include multiple files in their directory. This keeps
SKILL.md
focused on the essentials while letting Claude access detailed reference material only when needed. Large reference docs, API specifications, or example collections don’t need to load into context every time the skill runs.
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md (required - overview and navigation)
├── reference.md (detailed API docs - loaded when needed)
├── examples.md (usage examples - loaded when needed)
└── scripts/
└── helper.py (utility script - executed, not loaded)
Reference supporting files from
SKILL.md
so Claude knows what each file contains and when to load it:
## Additional resources
-
For complete API details, see [
reference.md
](
reference.md
)
-
For usage examples, see [
examples.md
](
examples.md
)
Keep
SKILL.md
under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to separate files.
​
Control who invokes a skill
By default, both you and Claude can invoke any skill. You can type
/skill-name
to invoke it directly, and Claude can load it automatically when relevant to your conversation. Two frontmatter fields let you restrict this:
disable-model-invocation: true
: Only you can invoke the skill. Use this for workflows with side effects or that you want to control timing, like
/commit
,
/deploy
, or
/send-slack-message
. You don’t want Claude deciding to deploy because your code looks ready.
user-invocable: false
: Only Claude can invoke the skill. Use this for background knowledge that isn’t actionable as a command. A
legacy-system-context
skill explains how an old system works. Claude should know this when relevant, but
/legacy-system-context
isn’t a meaningful action for users to take.
This example creates a deploy skill that only you can trigger. If you set
disable-model-invocation: true
, Claude can’t run the skill automatically:
---
name
:
deploy
description
:
Deploy the application to production
disable-model-invocation
:
true
---
Deploy $ARGUMENTS to production
:
1. Run the test suite
2. Build the application
3. Push to the deployment target
4. Verify the deployment succeeded
If Claude tries anyway, Claude Code blocks the call and instructs it not to reproduce the deploy steps another way, so expect Claude to suggest running
/deploy
yourself.
Here’s how the two fields affect invocation and context loading:
Frontmatter
You can invoke
Claude can invoke
When loaded into context
(default)
Yes
Yes
Description always in context, full skill loads when invoked
disable-model-invocation: true
Yes
No
Description not in context, full skill loads when you invoke
user-invocable: false
No
Yes
Description always in context, full skill loads when invoked
In a regular session, skill descriptions are loaded into context so Claude knows what’s available, but full skill content only loads when invoked.
Subagents with preloaded skills
work differently: the full skill content is injected at startup.
​
Skill content lifecycle
When you or Claude invoke a skill, the rendered
SKILL.md
content enters the conversation as a single message and stays there across later turns. This persistence applies to the skill’s instructions, not its permissions: an
allowed-tools
grant clears when you send your next message. Claude Code does not re-read the skill file on later turns, so write guidance that should apply throughout a task as standing instructions rather than one-time steps.
When Claude re-invokes a skill whose rendered content is identical to the copy already in context, Claude Code adds a short note that the skill is already loaded rather than a second copy of the content. When the rendered content differs, because the arguments changed or a
dynamic context
command produced new output, Claude Code appends the full content again.
Auto-compaction
carries invoked skills forward within a token budget. When the conversation is summarized to free context, Claude Code re-attaches the most recent invocation of each skill after the summary, keeping the first 5,000 tokens of each. Re-attached skills share a combined budget of 25,000 tokens. Claude Code fills this budget starting from the most recently invoked skill, so older skills can be dropped entirely after compaction if you have invoked many in one session.
If a skill seems to stop influencing behavior after the first response, the content is usually still present and the model is choosing other tools or approaches. Strengthen the skill’s
description
and instructions so the model keeps preferring it, or use
hooks
to enforce behavior deterministically. If the skill is large or you invoked several others after it, re-invoke it after compaction to restore the full content.
​
Pre-approve tools for a skill
The
allowed-tools
field grants permission for the listed tools during the turn that invokes the skill, so Claude can use them without prompting you for approval. The grant clears when you send your next message, even though the skill content
stays in context
; invoking the skill again re-applies it for that turn. It does not restrict which tools are available: every tool remains callable, and your
permission settings
still govern tools that are not listed. To pre-approve tools for the whole session rather than a single turn, add allow rules to those permission settings instead.
Workspace trust doesn’t gate this field. Claude Code applies a project skill’s
allowed-tools
whenever you or Claude invoke the skill, including in a
-p
run in a folder you’ve never trusted. A skill can grant itself broad tool access, so review the
allowed-tools
of skills checked into a repository before you run Claude Code there.
This skill lets Claude run git commands without per-use approval whenever you invoke it:
---
name
:
commit
description
:
Stage and commit the current changes
disable-model-invocation
:
true
allowed-tools
:
Bash(git add *) Bash(git commit *) Bash(git status *)
---
To remove tools from Claude’s available pool while a skill is active, list them in
disallowed-tools
in the skill’s frontmatter. The restriction clears when you send your next message. Like deny rules, the field can’t remove
EndConversation
while any other tool remains. To block tools across all skills and prompts, add deny rules in your
permission settings
.
​
Pass arguments to skills
Both you and Claude can pass arguments when invoking a skill. Arguments are available via the
$ARGUMENTS
placeholder.
This skill fixes a GitHub issue by number. The
$ARGUMENTS
placeholder gets replaced with whatever follows the skill name:
---
name
:
fix-issue
description
:
Fix a GitHub issue
disable-model-invocation
:
true
---
Fix GitHub issue $ARGUMENTS following our coding standards.
1. Read the issue description
2. Understand the requirements
3. Implement the fix
4. Write tests
5. Create a commit
When you run
/fix-issue 123
, Claude receives “Fix GitHub issue 123 following our coding standards…”
If you invoke a skill with arguments but no placeholder in the skill’s content receives one, Claude Code appends
ARGUMENTS: <your input>
to the end of the skill content so Claude still sees what you typed. A placeholder is
$ARGUMENTS
, an indexed form such as
$1
, or a named argument. An indexed placeholder with no argument at its position stays as literal text and doesn’t count as receiving one. A named placeholder counts even when its position has no argument, because it expands to an empty string.
You can also stack several skills at the start of one message. Typing
/write-tests /fix-issue 123
loads both skills and passes the trailing text
123
as
$ARGUMENTS
to each of them. Before v2.1.199, only the first skill loaded and received
/fix-issue 123
as literal argument text.
Claude Code expands the first skill plus up to five more stacked after it. Expansion stops at the first token that isn’t an inline user-invocable skill, so a skill that runs as a
forked subagent
, such as
/code-review
, or one whose arguments may themselves start with a slash command, such as
/loop
, also ends the run there. That token and everything after it become the argument text for every expanded skill.
/code-review
runs as a forked subagent from v2.1.218; on earlier versions it ran inline and stacked.
To access individual arguments by position, use
$ARGUMENTS[N]
or the shorter
$N
:
---
name
:
migrate-component
description
:
Migrate a component from one language to another
---
Migrate the $ARGUMENTS[0] component from $ARGUMENTS[1] to $ARGUMENTS[2].
Preserve all existing behavior and tests.
Running
/migrate-component SearchBar JavaScript TypeScript
replaces
$ARGUMENTS[0]
with
SearchBar
,
$ARGUMENTS[1]
with
JavaScript
, and
$ARGUMENTS[2]
with
TypeScript
. The same skill using the
$N
shorthand:
---
name
:
migrate-component
description
:
Migrate a component from one language to another
---
Migrate the $0 component from $1 to $2.
Preserve all existing behavior and tests.
​
Advanced patterns
​
Inject dynamic context
The
!`<command>`
syntax runs shell commands before the skill content is sent to Claude. The command output replaces the placeholder, so Claude receives actual data, not the command itself. Claude Code doesn’t run these commands on your machine when the skill is
synced from your claude.ai account
. This restriction requires Claude Code v2.1.228 or later.
This skill summarizes a pull request by fetching live PR data with the GitHub CLI. The
!`gh pr diff`
and other commands run first, and their output gets inserted into the prompt:
---
name
:
pr-summary
description
:
Summarize changes in a pull request
context
:
fork
agent
:
Explore
allowed-tools
:
Bash(gh *)
---
## Pull request context
-
PR diff
:
!`gh
pr diff`
-
PR comments
:
!`gh
pr view --comments`
-
Changed files
:
!`gh
pr diff --name-only`
## Your task
Summarize this pull request...
Substitution runs once over the original file. Command output is inserted as plain text and is not re-scanned for further
!`<command>`
placeholders, so a command cannot emit a placeholder for a later pass to expand.
The inline form is only recognized when
!
appears at the start of a line or immediately after whitespace. If
!
follows another character, as in
KEY=!`cmd`
, the placeholder is left as literal text and the command does not run.
For multi-line commands, use a fenced code block opened with
```!
instead of the inline form:
## Environment
```!
node --version
git stat

Skip to main content
Settings are the JSON keys that change how Claude Code behaves: which model it starts with, what it can run without asking, which files it can’t read, how it looks in your terminal, and what your organization enforces.
To look up a specific key, go to
All settings
, which lists every key with the file you set it in, its default, and an example.
Claude Code reads settings from JSON settings files such as
~/.claude/settings.json
. It looks for them in a few locations, and
the file it reads a setting from decides who the setting applies to
. This page covers those files: which one to put a setting in, how to change a setting and confirm it applied, and which value Claude Code uses when the same key is set in more than one file.
Configure permissions
covers what Claude Code can run without asking and how to write
allow
,
ask
, and
deny
rules.
This page covers Claude Code running on your machine: the terminal, the
VS Code
and
JetBrains
extensions, and the
desktop app
, which all read the same settings files. A
cloud session
runs on a different machine and reads only some of them; see
Settings in cloud sessions
.
​
Settings files and who they affect
Claude Code reads settings from four files, and an organization can also deliver managed settings from the claude.ai console. Each source has a scope: the set of people and projects a setting saved in it applies to, whether that’s just you, everyone in a project, or everyone in your organization.
Scope
File
Who it affects
Use it for

~/.claude/settings.json

Team permissions, hooks, plugins, and the environment variables the project needs
Project local

Managed

Everyone your organization deploys it to; nothing you set overrides it, apart from a few
security-sensitive exceptions
Security policy and compliance requirements
In the File column,
~/.claude
is the
.claude
folder in your home directory, and a bare
.claude
is the
.claude
folder inside your project.
​
Compare the scope of each settings file
Suppose you have three projects on your machine,
website/
,
api/
, and
acme-app/
, a teammate has their own clone of
acme-app/
, and you start a
cloud session
on
acme-app/
.
The graphic below shows which of those folders a setting applies in when you start Claude Code from them. Click a settings file to see the folders it reaches.
~/.claude/settings.json
: every project on your machine, and nothing on your teammate’s or in the cloud session
acme-app/.claude/settings.json
: your
acme-app/
. It reaches your teammate’s clone and the cloud session only if you commit the file to version control; until you do, it’s a file on your disk like any other and nobody else has it
acme-app/.claude/settings.local.json
: your
acme-app/
only. Claude Code adds it to your global git excludes the first time it writes the file, so it stays out of your commits; if you create the file by hand,
add it to
.gitignore
yourself
Managed settings
, whether a
managed-settings.json
file, an MDM policy, or
server-managed settings
from the claude.ai console: every project on every machine your organization deploys it to, or that you sign in to with your organization account. Only server-managed settings reach the cloud session
​
Find or create your settings files
Installing Claude Code doesn’t create any settings file. If your machine or project already has one, it came from one of these sources:
Managed
: your organization deploys it. You don’t create or edit it.
Shared project
: a project that already uses Claude Code may have one committed. If not, create it at
.claude/settings.json
in the project folder.
User
and
Project local
: create them yourself, or let Claude Code create them. It writes
~/.claude/settings.json
the first time you change an option in the
/config
menu that it stores in user settings, such as the theme, and
.claude/settings.local.json
the first time you give a standing approval on a permission prompt, such as “Yes, and don’t ask again” for a Bash command. A few
/config
options, including
Show tips
, save to
.claude/settings.local.json
instead of the user file.
On Windows,
~/.claude
means
%USERPROFILE%\.claude
. To keep the home-directory files somewhere else, set
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR
; Claude Code then stores your settings, session history, and plugins there instead.
Claude Code also keeps a fifth file,
~/.claude.json
, that it writes for itself; you don’t need to edit it. It holds your sign-in session,
MCP server
configurations, per-project state such as trust decisions, and the
global config keys
that
/config
writes for you.
​
Share settings with your team
Commit
.claude/settings.json
so everyone who clones the repository gets the same permissions, hooks, telemetry, and plugins. Each teammate can still override it for themselves in their own
.claude/settings.local.json
, so personal exceptions don’t need a commit. For a complete team file, see
a team’s shared settings
.
Some of what you commit waits until each teammate
trusts the folder
, and a few keys never take effect from a repository file;
Troubleshoot a setting that doesn’t apply
covers both.
​
Keep personal settings out of a repository
To change a setting for yourself in one project without changing it for your teammates, save it in
.claude/settings.local.json
inside the project. Claude Code applies that file over the committed
.claude/settings.json
, so if your team’s file sets
"model": "claude-sonnet-5"
and you want Opus, put
"model": "claude-opus-4-8"
in your local file and only your sessions change.
Claude Code also writes to this file, keeps it out of your commits, and applies its allow rules without the trust step:
Claude Code writes it too.
When Claude asks permission to run a Bash command and you choose “Yes, and don’t ask again”, Claude Code saves that
permission approval
here as an
allow
rule.
You don’t need to gitignore it yourself, unless you created it by hand.
The first time Claude Code writes the file in a git repository that doesn’t already ignore it, it adds
**/.claude/settings.local.json
to your global git excludes file, so the file stays out of your commits in every repository. That file is
core.excludesFile
when your global git config sets it to an absolute or
~
-prefixed path; otherwise it’s
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore
, or
~/.config/git/ignore
when
XDG_CONFIG_HOME
is unset. If you created the file by hand and Claude Code hasn’t written to it yet, add it to
.gitignore
yourself.
Its allow rules don’t wait for trust while the file stays untracked.
Because the file is yours and not the repository’s, Claude Code applies its
allow
rules without the
workspace trust
step it requires for the committed file. If the file is tracked by git, the trust step applies to it too; see
When your local settings file needs trust
.

When Claude asks permission to run a Bash command and you choose “Yes, and don’t ask again”, Claude Code saves that approval as an
allow
rule in
.claude/settings.local.json
. If you start Claude Code in a subdirectory of a git repository, it reads and writes that file at the repository root and applies the approval across the whole repository. In a
worktree
, it uses the file at the main checkout’s root.
Two rules qualify the root location:
When the file stays with
.claude/settings.json
instead
: outside a git repository, when the repository root is your home directory, on Windows, or when the repository root or its
.git
or
.claude
entry isn’t owned by your user.
Paths in the file don’t anchor at the repository root
: a permission rule that starts with
/
or a relative sandbox path
anchors at the session’s primary working directory
instead.
Before v2.1.211, Claude Code kept the file in the starting directory. It still reads a file an earlier version left there alongside the root file; where both set the same key, the root’s value applies, and permission rules from both files apply. The Agent SDK’s
resolveSettings()
helper always reads the file from the starting directory.
Claude Code reads the shared
.claude/settings.json
from the session’s
primary working directory
, so to use a file committed at the repository root, start Claude Code there. After you
move the session with
/cd
, Claude Code reads both project files from the new directory instead, placing the local file by the same rules. Reading them from the directory you moved to requires Claude Code v2.1.246 or later.
​
Check what your organization enforces
If your organization manages Claude Code, some settings are decided for you and nothing you put in your own files changes them. To see which, run
/status
: the
Setting sources
line names the managed source that applies to you. Managed settings apply wherever Claude Code runs on this machine;
What a developer can change
covers local admin rights and tools other than Claude Code.
Managed settings reach you through the
delivery mechanisms
on the managed settings page, most commonly:
Server-managed settings
, which Claude Code fetches from the claude.ai admin console or a self-hosted
Claude apps gateway
MDM or OS-level policies, and
managed-settings.json
files in a system directory
An embedding host such as Claude Desktop, through the SDK
managedSettings
option; see
Control policy from an embedding host
In a
Cowork
session that runs on your machine in the Claude Desktop app, Claude Code doesn’t fetch server-managed settings from the claude.ai admin console, and it reads policy deployed to your device unless your organization’s Claude Desktop configuration sets
requireCoworkFullVmSandbox
.
Where and when a policy applies

If you’re the administrator,

​
Change a setting
You can change a setting from the
/config
menu, by editing a settings file, or for one session from the command line.
Claude Code’s system prompt isn’t published. To give Claude standing instructions, use
CLAUDE.md
files
or the
--append-system-prompt
flag.
​
Use the /config menu
Run
/config
inside Claude Code and open the
Config
tab. It lists a short set of personal options such as theme, editor mode, and verbose output, not every settings key. Select an option to change it; Claude Code saves it for you:
Most options
:
~/.claude/settings.json
A few options, such as Show tips
:
.claude/settings.local.json
The
global config options
:
~/.claude.json
To set one option without the menu, pass
key=value
, such as
/config verbose=true
.
/config
is part of the terminal interface. The
VS Code
chat panel and the
desktop app
don’t open it; change settings there by editing a settings file or through those apps’ own settings.
​
Edit a settings file
Open the settings file for the scope you want in your editor and add or change a key. Settings files are strict JSON: a
//
comment or a trailing comma is a syntax error, and Claude Code reports the file as a
Settings Error
at the next start. For example, to let Claude Code run your lint and test commands without asking and stop it reading
.env
files, add this to
~/.claude/settings.json
:
~/.claude/settings.json
{
"$schema"
:
"https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-settings.json"
,
"permissions"
: {
"allow"
: [
"Bash(npm run lint)"
,
"Bash(npm run test *)"
],
"deny"
: [
"Read(./.env)"
,
"Read(./.env.*)"
]
}
}
Each entry under
permissions
is a rule that names a tool and what it may do;
Configure permissions
explains the syntax. The
$schema
line points to the
published JSON schema
for Claude Code settings, which gives you autocomplete and inline validation in VS Code, Cursor, and any other editor that supports JSON schema. The schema can lag behind the newest CLI releases, so a validation warning on a recently documented key doesn’t mean your configuration is invalid.
After you save, run
/status
inside Claude Code to confirm the file loaded;
Confirm what loaded
says what the
Setting sources
line shows and how a broken file is reported.
For a complete personal file, team file, and organization file, each shown with a comment on every key it sets, see the
example settings files
.
​
Change a setting for one session
To try a value without saving it, set it when you start Claude Code. The value applies to that session and your settings files stay as they were. You have three ways to do it:
--settings
: pass a key as JSON, inline or as a path to a file. Claude Code applies it above your user, project, and local files and below managed settings. It can set any key your user settings file can set; it can’t set
Managed
or
Global config
keys.
A flag for that key
: some keys have their own flag, such as
--model
for
model
and
--effort
for
effortLevel
and
modelSettings
.
An environment variable
: export the key’s paired variable before you run
claude
, such as
ANTHROPIC_MODEL
for
model
.
Each key’s entry on the
settings reference
lists its per-session overrides and which one takes precedence, so check the entry for the key you want to change.
Commands you run inside a session mostly save your choice: when you change a setting in
/config
, Claude Code writes it to your settings files, and
/model
saves the value as your default for new sessions.
If you press
s
in the
/model
picker, Claude Code switches the model without saving it as your user default.
Adjust effort level
says which
/effort
picks Claude Code saves as your default for the model you’re using and which apply to the current session only.
For example, to start one session on Opus without changing your default:
claude
--settings
'{"model": "claude-opus-4-8"}'
​
When edits take effect
Claude Code watches your settings files and reloads them when they change, so it applies most edits to the running session without a restart, including edits to
permissions
,
hooks
, and credential helpers such as
apiKeyHelper
. Claude Code also loads a settings file you create mid-session if its folder existed when the session started. For the project’s
.claude/
folder, it loads the file even when you create the folder in the same session.
The reload covers user, project, local, and managed settings, and Claude Code runs the
ConfigChange
hook
for each settings-file change it detects, not for managed settings that arrive from MDM or the claude.ai console. Managed settings that arrive through MDM or from the claude.ai console reach a running session on a schedule rather than on save; the
delivery table
gives it per source.
Claude Code reads some keys only once, at session start, so an edit to one of them doesn’t reach the running session. Admin-side keys that also wait for a restart, such as
requiredMinimumVersion
, are listed under
where and when a policy applies
. The ones you’re most likely to edit mid-session:
model
: use
/model
to switch mid-session. Each model has its own prompt cache, so the first request after a switch re-reads the whole conversation uncached; see
Switching models
effortLevel
and
modelSettings
: use
/effort
to change effort mid-session
​
Confirm what loaded
Run
/status
inside Claude Code to see which settings sources are active. The
Status
tab includes a
Setting sources
line that lists each settings file Claude Code loaded for the current session, such as
User settings
or
Project local settings
. When
managed settings
are in effect, the managed settings entry shows in parentheses how they reached your machine.
The line confirms which files Claude Code read; it doesn’t show which file supplied each key. To list entries Claude Code rejected, run
claude doctor
; for a model that project or managed settings set, the startup header names the file that set it.
/status
and
/config
open the same dialog on different tabs, and the
Config
tab isn’t a view of your
settings.json
contents.
​
Fix a broken settings file
If you mistype JSON or set a key to a value Claude Code doesn’t accept, Claude Code tells you at the start of an interactive session. What it shows depends on how much of the file is affected:
Settings Error
: a user, project, or local file has invalid JSON or a value the schema rejects. At the start of an interactive session Claude Code shows a dialog that lets you fix the file with Claude’s help, exit, or continue without the broken settings.
Settings Warning
: only individual entries fail, such as a malformed permission rule or an unknown hook event name. Claude Code skips those values and keeps the rest of the file in effect.
Managed settings
: Claude Code keeps enforcing the rest of the file.
Invalid entries in managed settings
says what it drops and which keys fall back to a stricter value until you fix them. For a managed settings document that isn’t valid JSON, see
Managed settings document could not be parsed
.
Configuration error
:
~/.claude.json
can’t be parsed. Claude Code copies the broken file to
~/.claude/backups/.claude.json.corrupted.<timestamp>
and asks whether to exit and fix it by hand or reset to the default configuration; a
-p
run prints the error and exits. To recover your previous state, copy back one of the five most recent
.claude.json.backup.<timestamp>
files in
~/.claude/backups/
, which Claude Code saves before it writes the file.
After you continue, run
/status
to see the affected files and
claude doctor
for the details of each error.
A
-p
run shows no dialog. Unless
a managed settings document can’t be parsed
, Claude Code skips the broken file or values and continues with the rest, so after a
-p
run that ignores a setting, run
claude doctor
to see what it dropped.
​
Settings precedence
When the same key appears in more than one place, Claude Code uses the value from the highest level that sets it. The stack below shows the levels, highest on top; a key at a higher level overrides the same key anywhere below it.
In order, highest precedence first:
Managed settings
: settings your organization deploys, by a
managed-settings.json
file, an MDM policy, or
server-managed settings
from the claude.ai console. Nothing you set overrides them: a key you pass with
--settings
doesn’t override the same managed key, and a flag such as
--model
picks only from the models your organization allows. A managed
model
sets the model each session starts with, and you can still switch with
/model
; the lock is
availableModels
, which constrains
/model
,
--model
, and the
model
key in your own files. When your organization delivers more than one managed source, the rules for
precedence within the managed tier
say what Claude Code reads from each.
Command line arguments
: flags you pass when you start
claude
from a terminal, for one session; see
Change a setting for one session
. Claude Code merges JSON you pass with
--settings <file-or-json>
with your settings files by the same rules as the other levels: it takes a key you set here over the same key in local, project, or user settings, and keeps the lower-level value for a key you omit.
Project local settings
(
.claude/settings.local.json
): your personal settings for this project.
Shared project settings
(
.claude/settings.json
): settings your team checks into source control.
User settings
(
~/.claude/settings.json
): your personal settings for every project.
Environment variables aren’t a level in this stack. When a behavior has both a shell variable and a settings key, which one applies is decided per pair, not by level:
ANTHROPIC_MODEL
exported in your shell applies over the
model
key from any file, while
ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_MODEL
applies only when no file sets
model
. The
environment variables reference
says which keys have a pair and which one Claude Code reads first. An
env
block inside a settings file is an ordinary key and follows the levels above.
For a few security-sensitive keys, Claude Code honors a stricter value from a lower level over a managed value;
Exceptions to managed settings precedence
lists them.
​
Lists merge instead of overriding
When you set the same list key, such as
permissions.allow
, in more than one file, Claude Code combines the lists instead of picking one, so each file can add entries without removing another file’s. Four keys that hold model lists or per-model entries follow their own rules:
fallbackModel
is an ordered chain where position carries meaning, so Claude Code takes the whole value from the highest-precedence file that defines it.
modelPicker
holds one ordered list of rows plus a replace flag, so Claude Code never merges rows from two sources. It takes the whole value from the highest of managed settings,
--settings
, and user settings that defines it, and ignores the key in project and local settings. Requires Claude Code v2.1.242 or later.
availableModels
: when the managed settings Claude Code applies define it, Claude Code applies that list as-is and ignores entries you add in user, project, or local settings, unless an app that embeds Claude Code supplies its own model list; see
Exceptions to managed settings precedence
. Across managed sources the list never merges either;
how Claude Code combines managed sources
says which source’s list applies. Across non-managed scopes Claude Code merges the arrays as usual.
modelSettings
: Claude Code resolves it one model at a time, together with
effortLevel
. The
modelSettings
entry states which file’s value applies to a model.
​
Precedence examples
While Claude works, Claude Code shows a one-line tip under the spinner, such as “Use /config to change your default permission mode (including Plan Mode)”. Suppose you want those tips off, so you set
spinnerTipsEnabled
to
false
in
~/.claude/settings.json
. Each scenario below is something that can turn them back on, and what you can do about it.
​
Team settings override personal settings
Your team’s
.claude/settings.json
sets it to
true
. Claude Code uses the project value because shared project sits above user, so you see tips in that project and nowhere else.
You can get your value back: add
"spinnerTipsEnabled": false
to
.claude/settings.local.json
in that project. Project local sits above shared project, so your sessions there stop showing tips and your teammates’ sessions don’t change.
​
Organization settings override everything
Your organization’s managed settings set it to
true
. Nothing you put in user, project, or local settings turns tips off, and neither does
--settings
. Managed is the top level.
You can’t get your value back. Run
/status
to see which managed source applies, and ask your administrator if the policy should change.
​
The command line overrides your files for one session
You started the session with
claude --settings '{"spinnerTipsEnabled": true}'
. Command line sits above every file except managed, so that session shows tips even though your files say
false
.
You get your value back on the next session;
--settings
lasts one session and doesn’t write to any file.
​
A flag or environment variable sets the same thing
Some keys have a command line flag or an environment variable that overrides the settings value regardless of which file set it:
ANTHROPIC_MODEL
overrides the
model
setting, and
--model
overrides both for a session.
Whether you can get your value back depends on the key: unset the variable or drop the flag, and check the key’s entry on the
settings reference
and the variable’s row on the
environment variables reference
for which one Claude Code uses.
​
Troubleshoot a setting that doesn’t apply
When you set a key and Claude Code doesn’t behave as if you had, start with
/status
to see which files it loaded, then find your symptom below.
Debug your configuration
covers the wider checks, including a clean-configuration test.
​
A value you set is ignored
Something else is setting the same key, the file can’t set that value, or the file didn’t load:
A higher level sets it.
Another settings file, a
--settings
flag, or a managed source sets the key above yours; the
stack
says which. A flag or environment variable can also override the key on its own, decided key by key; the key’s entry on the
settings reference
says which one Claude Code uses, and the
env
entry
covers a managed
env
value versus a shell export.
A security key keeps its strict value.
For a few keys Claude Code honors the restrictive value from any file, so a project
true
for
disableClaudeAiConnectors
stays on; see
Exceptions to managed settings precedence
.
The file can’t set that value.
permissions.defaultMode
values
auto
and
bypassPermissions
don’t take effect from project or local settings; set them in user or managed settings instead, or pass
--permission-mode
for one session. Before v2.1.257,
bypassPermissions
took effect from any file.
The file is broken.
Invalid JSON or a rejected value makes Claude Code skip the file or the entry; see
Fix a broken settings file
.
​
A change you made in Claude Code is lost in new sessions
When you save a choice for new sessions from inside Claude Code, such as a default model with
/model
, Claude Code writes it to your user settings file,
~/.claude/settings.json
. If you can’t write to that file, for example because another tool generates it or links it to a read-only copy, the change applies to the current session and is gone in the next one. Set the key in the tool that generates the file, or replace the file with one you can write to.
If you can write to the file and the change still doesn’t last, check whether the change was
for one session only
or
a higher level sets the same key
. For the
model
key,
A new session starts on a different model than you picked
lists more causes.
​
A managed change hasn’t reached you
Managed sources reach a running session on the schedule in the
delivery table
, so restart the session first. If
/status
then names a different source than the one your administrator changed, a higher-priority source applies;
How Claude Code combines managed sources
gives the order.
​
A committed key doesn’t reach teammates
Two things keep a key in
.claude/settings.json
from applying for everyone who clones it:
Claude Code ignores the key in a repository file.
Look for
User, local, or managed
,
User or managed
,
Managed
, or
Global config
in the Scope column of the
settings index
. Those keys never apply from the shared file, apart from a few that a repository file can still switch off. Each of those entries says so on its Scope line.
Global config
keys apply only from
~/.claude.json
.
The key waits for trust.
permissions.allow
rules,
permissions.additionalDirectories
,
extraKnownMarketplaces
, and most
env
values apply only after each teammate
trusts the folder
. Until then they still see prompts and don’t get plugins from a marketplace the file declares.
deny
and
ask
rules apply right away.
​
Permission rules combine differently than you expected
You chose “Yes, and don’t ask again” on a permission prompt but still get prompted for the same tool.
That choice saved an
allow
rule to your local file, and an
allow
rule there doesn’t outrank an
ask
rule from a project or managed file;
how permission rules combine
explains the order. In the VS Code extension the approval card lets you pick the destination file, including the project’s shared file, which changes the rule for everyone; in the CLI, Claude Code writes only to your local file.
Your organization’s allow rules still apply alongside yours.
That’s expected: Claude Code merges
permissions.allow
across scopes, unless your organization sets
allowManagedPermissionRulesOnly
.
​
Exceptions to managed settings precedence
For a few keys whose values restrict a session, Claude Code honors a restrictive value from a scope that otherwise couldn’t override managed settings. Find the key in this table to see which value it honors and from where.

An app that runs Claude Code inside itself and sets
CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_MANAGED_BY_HOST
is also an exception. Claude Code takes that app’s model configuration over the
model
,
fallbackModel
,
modelPicker
, and
modelOverrides
keys from every managed source, and over the model-selection variables in a managed
env
block, such as
ANTHROPIC_MODEL
and the
ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL
family. Claude Code keeps a managed
availableModels
allowlist in force unless the app supplies its own.
​
Settings in cloud sessions
A
cloud session
runs in a
cloud environment
on a fresh clone of your repository, not on your machine. That changes which settings reach it:
Shared project settings
(
.claude/settings.json
): read in a session with one repository, because the file is part of the clone and the session starts inside it. Commit a setting there to apply it in those sessions. A session with several repositories starts above the clones, so from each repository’s
.claude/settings.json
it loads only the plugins and marketplaces the file declares, not permission rules, hooks,
env
, or other keys; see
What carries over from your setup
.
User and project local settings
(
~/.claude/settings.json
and
.claude/settings.local.json
): not read. Both stay on your machine, and the local file isn’t in the clone.
Managed settings
: only
server-managed settings
reach a cloud session; a
managed-settings.json
file or MDM profile on your device doesn’t. A
self-hosted environment
also reads the managed settings file in its runner image.
How Claude Code combines managed sources
says when that file applies.
/config
: in your browser at claude.ai/code, opens the Claude Code section of your claude.ai settings instead of changing a value. To change a setting for a cloud session, set an
environment variable
on the environment, or in a session with one repository, commit the key to that repository’s
.claude/settings.json
.
What carries over from your setup
lists the rest:

Skip to main content
Subagents are specialized AI assistants that handle specific types of tasks. Use one when a side task would flood your main conversation with search results, logs, or file contents you won’t reference again: the subagent does that work in its own context and returns only the summary. Define a custom subagent when you keep spawning the same kind of worker with the same instructions.
Each subagent runs in its own context window with a custom system prompt, specific tool access, and independent permissions. When Claude encounters a task that matches a subagent’s description, it delegates to that subagent, which works independently and returns results. To see the context savings in practice, the
context window visualization
walks through a session where a subagent handles research in its own separate window.
Subagents work within a single session. To run many independent sessions in parallel and monitor them from one place, see
background agents
. For separate sessions that pass messages to each other, see
cross-session messaging
. For a coordinated team of sessions Claude spawns and supervises, see
agent teams
.
Subagents help you:
Preserve context
by keeping exploration and implementation out of your main conversation
Enforce constraints
by limiting which tools a subagent can use
Reuse configurations
across projects with user-level subagents
Specialize behavior
with focused system prompts for specific domains
Control costs
by routing tasks to faster, cheaper models like Haiku
Claude uses each subagent’s description to decide when to delegate tasks. When you create a subagent, write a clear description so Claude knows when to use it.
Those descriptions take up context, so keep them short. When the combined descriptions of your subagents, except the built-in ones, exceed 15,000 tokens, Claude Code shows a
warning at startup with the total token count
. Trim the
description
fields of your subagents, and move detail into each subagent’s system prompt, which only loads when that subagent runs.
​
Built-in subagents
Claude Code includes built-in subagents that Claude automatically uses when appropriate. Each inherits the parent conversation’s permissions; most run with a restricted tool set.
Explore and Plan skip your CLAUDE.md files and the parent session’s git status to keep research fast and inexpensive. Every other built-in and
custom subagent
loads both, unless its definition sets the
omitClaudeMd
field to skip the user, project, and local CLAUDE.md files. For the full breakdown of what reaches a subagent, see
what loads at startup
.
Explore
Plan
General-purpose
Other
A fast, read-only agent optimized for searching and analyzing codebases.
Model
: inherits from the main conversation, capped at Opus on the Claude API, so Explore never runs on a more expensive model than the one you already chose for the session, unless you set
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL
and
force it onto every subagent
Tools
: read-only tools; Write and Edit are denied
Purpose
: file discovery, code search, codebase exploration
As of v2.1.198, Explore inherits the main conversation’s model instead of always running on Haiku. On the Claude API, the inherited model is capped at Opus: a main conversation on a higher tier runs Explore on Opus, and a main conversation on Sonnet or Haiku runs Explore on that same model. On any other provider, such as
Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud’s Agent Platform, Microsoft Foundry, or Claude Platform on AWS
, Explore inherits the main conversation’s model directly.
A
user or project subagent
named
Explore
overrides the built-in and keeps its own
model
field, so define one with
model: haiku
to keep exploration on a lower-cost model.
Claude delegates to Explore when it needs to search or understand a codebase without making changes. This keeps exploration results out of your main conversation context.
When invoking Explore, Claude specifies a thoroughness level:
quick
for targeted lookups,
medium
for balanced exploration, or
very thorough
for comprehensive analysis.
A research agent used during
plan mode

Model
: inherits from the main conversation, unless you set

Tools

Purpose
: codebase research for planning
When you’re in plan mode and Claude needs to understand your codebase, it delegates research to the Plan subagent so that exploration output stays in a separate context window while the main conversation remains read-only.
A capable agent for complex, multi-step tasks that require both exploration and action.

: complex research, multi-step operations, code modifications
Claude delegates to general-purpose when the task requires both exploration and modification, complex reasoning to interpret results, or multiple dependent steps.
Claude Code includes additional helper agents for specific tasks. These are typically invoked automatically, so you don’t need to use them directly.

When you ask questions about Claude Code features
Built-in subagents are registered by default in interactive sessions. To restrict them:
To block a specific built-in type, add it to
permissions.deny
as shown in
Disable specific subagents
.
To prevent Claude from delegating to any subagent, deny the
Agent
tool itself with
permissions.deny
.
To remove only the built-in
Explore
and
Plan
subagents, set
CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_EXPLORE_PLAN_AGENTS=1
. Claude reads and explores files directly instead of delegating to them. Requires Claude Code v2.1.198 or later.
In
non-interactive mode
and the
Agent SDK
, set
CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_DISABLE_BUILTIN_AGENTS=1
to remove all built-in types and supply only your own.
An Agent tool call that omits
subagent_type
fails with
subagent_type is required
when the session has no
general-purpose
subagent to fall back on.
Beyond these built-in subagents, you can create your own with custom prompts, tool restrictions, permission modes, hooks, and skills. The following sections show how to get started and customize subagents.
​
Quickstart: create your first subagent
Subagents are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. To create one, ask Claude to write it for you, or
write the file yourself
.
As of v2.1.198, the
/agents
command no longer opens the interactive creation wizard; running it prints a reminder to ask Claude or edit
.claude/agents/
directly. Subagent files, frontmatter fields, and the
.claude/agents/
and
~/.claude/agents/
locations are unchanged; only the terminal wizard is removed.
This walkthrough creates a user-level subagent that reviews code and suggests improvements.
1
Ask Claude to create the subagent
In Claude Code, describe the subagent you want and where to save it:
Create a personal code-improver subagent in ~/.claude/agents/ that scans
files and suggests improvements for readability, performance, and best
practices. It should explain each issue, show the current code, and
provide an improved version. Make it read-only and have it use Sonnet.
Claude writes the file with a
name
, a
description
, a
tools
list, a
model
, and a system prompt.
2
Review the file
Open
~/.claude/agents/code-improver.md
and confirm the frontmatter matches what you asked for. The result looks like this:
---
name
:
code-improver
description
:
Scans files and suggests improvements for readability, performance, and best practices. Use after writing or modifying code.
tools
:
Read, Grep, Glob
model
:
sonnet
---
You are a code improvement specialist. For each issue you find, explain
the problem, show the current code, and provide an improved version.
Because the file lives in
~/.claude/agents/
, the subagent is available in every project on your machine. To scope it to one project instead, move it to that project’s
.claude/agents/
directory.
Choose the subagent scope
compares the two.
3
Try it out
Ask Claude to delegate to the new subagent:
Use the code-improver agent to suggest improvements in this project
Claude delegates to your new subagent, which scans the codebase and returns improvement suggestions. In the transcript, the delegation appears as a tool call row showing the subagent’s name followed by a short task description, such as
code-improver(Suggest code improvements)
.
If Claude can’t find the new subagent, restart Claude Code and try again. This happens only when
~/.claude/agents/
didn’t exist before the session started, because a running session doesn’t detect a newly created
agents
directory.
You now have a subagent you can use in any project on your machine to analyze codebases and suggest improvements.
You can also write subagent files by hand, define them via CLI flags, or distribute them through plugins. The following sections cover all configuration options.
On Claude Code v2.1.197 and earlier,
/agents
opens an interactive wizard with a
Running
tab that lists live subagents and a
Library
tab for creating, editing, and deleting them.
​
Configure subagents
A subagent’s file location determines who it’s available to, and its frontmatter determines what it can do. This section covers where subagent files live and every field they support.
​
Choose the subagent scope
Store subagent files in different locations depending on scope. When multiple subagents share the same name, Claude Code uses the one from the higher-priority location.

Installed with
plugins
Project subagents
(
.claude/agents/
) are ideal for subagents specific to a codebase. Check them into version control so your team can use and improve them collaboratively.
Project subagents are discovered by walking up from the current working directory, so every
.claude/agents/
between there and the repository root is scanned. As of v2.1.178, when more than one of these nested directories defines the same
name
, Claude Code uses the definition closest to the working directory.
When you add a directory with
--add-dir
or
/add-dir
, Claude Code also loads its
.claude/agents/
folder, alongside your project subagents. See
Additional directories
for which other configuration types load from
--add-dir
. To share subagents across projects without
--add-dir
, use
~/.claude/agents/
or a
plugin
.
User subagents
(
~/.claude/agents/
) are personal subagents available in all your projects.
Claude Code scans
.claude/agents/
and
~/.claude/agents/
recursively, so you can organize definitions into subfolders such as
agents/review/
or
agents/research/
. The subdirectory path doesn’t affect how a subagent is identified or invoked, because identity comes only from the
name
frontmatter field.
Keep
name
values unique across the whole tree: if two files under the same
.claude/agents/
directory, including its subfolders, declare the same name, Claude Code loads only one of them, chosen by filesystem read order rather than a documented precedence. Across nested project directories, the definition closest to the working directory wins, as described above. The
/doctor
setup checkup reports files in the same directory that share a name and proposes renaming or removing all but one. Before v2.1.205,
/doctor
opened a diagnostics screen that listed duplicates and showed which definition was active.
Plugin
agents/
directories are also scanned recursively. Unlike project and user scopes, a subfolder inside a plugin’s
agents/
directory becomes part of the
scoped identifier
: a file at
agents/review/security.md
in plugin
my-plugin
registers as
my-plugin:review:security
.
CLI-defined subagents
are passed as JSON when launching Claude Code. They exist only for that session and aren’t saved to disk, making them useful for quick testing or automation scripts. You can define multiple subagents in a single
--agents
call:
macOS, Linux, WSL
Windows PowerShell
claude
--agents

The

, and

. Use
prompt
for the system prompt, equivalent to the markdown body in file-based subagents.
Each top-level key in the JSON is the agent’s name. Don’t start a name with
-
.
For what Claude Code does with a value it can’t load, and the flags and environment variable that skip that check, see
Invalid --agents configuration
.
Managed subagents
are deployed by organization administrators. Place markdown files in
.claude/agents/
inside the
managed settings directory
, using the same frontmatter format as project and user subagents. Managed definitions take precedence over project and user subagents with the same name.
Plugin subagents
come from
plugins
you’ve installed. They load automatically alongside your custom subagents and appear in the @-mention typeahead under their scoped name. See the
plugin components reference
for details on creating plugin subagents.
For security reasons, plugin subagents don’t support the
hooks
,
mcpServers
, or
permissionMode
frontmatter fields. These fields are ignored when loading agents from a plugin. If you need them, copy the agent file into
.claude/agents/
or
~/.claude/agents/
. You can also add rules to
permissions.allow
in
settings.json
or
settings.local.json
, but these rules apply to the entire session, not only the plugin subagent.
Subagent definitions from any of these scopes are also available to
agent teams
: when spawning a teammate, you can reference a subagent type, and Claude Code applies parts of that definition to the teammate. See
agent teams
for which parts apply in each display mode.
​
Write subagent files
Subagent files use YAML frontmatter for configuration, followed by the system prompt in Markdown:
Claude Code watches
~/.claude/agents/
and
.claude/agents/
. When you add or edit a subagent file on disk, or ask Claude to write one for you, Claude Code detects the change within a few seconds and the next delegation uses the updated definition, with no restart needed.
Three cases still need a restart:
The watcher covers only directories that existed when the session started, so after creating a scope’s first agent file in a new
agents
directory, restart to load it.
Claude Code doesn’t watch
.claude/agents/
inside directories added with
--add-dir
or
/add-dir
, so after adding or editing a subagent there, restart to load the change.
Sessions started with
--disable-slash-commands
don’t watch these directories at all.

---
You are a code reviewer. When invoked, analyze the code and provide
specific, actionable feedback on quality, security, and best practices.
The frontmatter defines the subagent’s metadata and configuration. The body becomes the system prompt that guides the subagent’s behavior. Subagents receive only this system prompt plus basic environment details like the working directory, not the Claude Code system prompt.
In
non-interactive mode
, pass
--append-subagent-system-prompt
to append your text to the end of every subagent’s system prompt, nested subagents included, apart from a
forked subagent
, which reuses the conversation’s own prompt. Requires Claude Code v2.1.205 or later. If your text is too long to pass on the command line, save it to a file and pass the path with
--append-subagent-system-prompt-file
instead. The file flag requires Claude Code v2.1.261 or later.
A subagent starts in the main conversation’s current working directory. Within a subagent,
cd
commands don’t persist between Bash or PowerShell tool calls and don’t affect the main conversation’s working directory. To give the subagent an isolated copy of the repository instead, set
isolation: worktree
.
A subagent with
isolation: worktree
runs its Bash and PowerShell commands inside its worktree. A command whose working directory resolves to your main checkout instead, for example because the worktree directory was removed while the subagent was running, fails with an error. Before v2.1.203, such a command could run in the main checkout.
This working-directory check covers the whole repository containing the directory you launched Claude Code from. When your session runs in a linked
worktree
of its own, the check also covers the main checkout that worktree is linked from. Before v2.1.210, the check covered only the launch directory itself. A command whose working directory resolved elsewhere in the same repository, such as the repository root when you launched Claude Code from a monorepo subdirectory, ran there instead of failing.
For Bash commands, Claude Code also checks the command itself in two ways:
It blocks a command that redirects git into the main checkout.
It refuses a command when it can’t verify from the command text that any git the command runs stays inside the worktree, for example when the command name is computed at runtime.
The redirect vectors and the shape rules are listed under
How Claude Code enforces isolation
. PowerShell commands get only the working-directory check.
Monitor
commands go through the same working-directory and command-content checks as Bash commands.
When the main conversation itself runs isolated in a worktree, Claude Code applies the same checks to the session and to every subagent it spawns, including subagents without
isolation: worktree
; see
How Claude Code enforces isolation
.

Subagent files Claude Code skips
Claude Code skips a file in a project, user, or managed
agents
directory, or in one under a directory you add with
--add-dir
, without reporting it in the session, when the frontmatter has any of these problems:
No
name
: Claude Code treats the file as documentation kept beside your agents.
An opening
---
that isn’t the file’s first line
: Claude Code reads the file as having no frontmatter and treats it as documentation.
A
name
that starts with
-
or contains
:
: Claude Code skips the file and writes an error to the debug log. See the
name
row in the table above.
A
name
but no
description
: Claude Code skips the file and writes the reason to the debug log.
YAML that doesn’t parse
: Claude Code reads no fields from the file, skips it, and writes the parse error to the debug log.
To see the debug log, run Claude Code with
--debug
.
A
plugin subagent
whose frontmatter has no
name
or doesn’t parse still loads, under its filename.
Check an
agents
directory before a session
To find files in an
agents
directory whose frontmatter doesn’t parse, run
claude plugin validate
against the directory, for example
.claude/agents
or
~/.claude/agents
. Claude Code checks only
the directory you name
, and doesn’t flag a file whose frontmatter parses but has no
name
. Requires Claude Code v2.1.233 or later.
​
Choose a model
The
model
field controls which model the subagent uses:
Model alias
: use one of the available aliases:
sonnet
,
opus
,
haiku
, or
fable
Full model ID
: use a full model ID such as
claude-opus-5
or
claude-sonnet-5
. Accepts the same values as the
--model
flag
inherit
: use the same model as the main conversation
When Claude invokes a subagent, it can also pass a
model
parameter for that specific invocation. Claude Code resolves the subagent’s model in this order:
The per-invocation
model
parameter
The subagent definition’s
model
frontmatter, where
inherit
selects the main conversation’s model
The
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL
environment variable, when you set it to a model alias or model ID
The main conversation’s model
Setting
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL
by itself doesn’t change the model the built-in Explore and Plan subagents run on. To change it, see
Run every subagent on one model
.
Before v2.1.251,
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL
came first in this order and overrode both the per-invocation parameter and the frontmatter, including
model: inherit
.
Setting the variable to
inherit
is the same as leaving it unset. Before v2.1.196, that value forced subagents onto the main conversation’s model and ignored the other sources.
Claude Code checks the per-invocation parameter, frontmatter, and environment variable values against your organization’s
availableModels
allowlist. For a blocked value, it substitutes another model:
When the blocked value is a family alias such as
opus
, Claude Code runs the subagent on the newest version of that family the allowlist permits, following the same
substitution rules and provider scope
as
/model
. Before v2.1.222, Claude Code ran the subagent on the inherited model for a blocked family alias as well.
For any other blocked value, on providers where that substitution doesn’t operate, or when the allowlist permits no version of the family, Claude Code runs the subagent on the inherited model instead. If you set
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL
, Claude Code tries that model first, under these same rules.
In interactive sessions, Claude Code shows a warning naming the requested model and the model the subagent runs on, for either substitution.
To check which model a subagent is running on, run
/tasks
. Claude Code names the model on the subagent’s row, and adds the
effort level
when the subagent’s definition, or the skill it forked from, sets
effort
. Requires Claude Code v2.1.242 or later.
A per-invocation
model
parameter also applies when the subagent is
resumed or sent a follow-up message
, so the subagent stays on that model. Before v2.1.211, resuming dropped the per-invocation value and the subagent reverted to its definition’s
model
field or, without one, the main conversation’s model.
As of v2.1.198, subagents also inherit the main conversation’s
extended thinking
configuration: if thinking is on in your session, it’s on for the subagent, and if it’s off, it stays off. There is no per-subagent thinking setting. Before v2.1.198, subagents ran with extended thinking disabled regardless of the main conversation’s setting.
​
Run every subagent on one model
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL
is a default, so a subagent’s definition or a model Claude passes still takes precedence over it. To apply one model to every subagent,
teammate
, and
workflow agent
, also set
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE
to
1
. Requires Claude Code v2.1.257 or later.
If you set both variables, subagents run on the model in
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL
.
If you set only
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE
, subagents run on the main conversation’s model.
For example, to run every subagent on Haiku, set both variables in the
env
block of a
settings file
:
{
"env"
: {
"CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL"
:
"haiku"
,
"CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE"
:
"1"
}
}
To check that the setting took effect, run
/tasks
while a subagent is running. The subagent’s row shows the model it runs on.
While
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE
is
on
, Claude Code ignores the
model
field of every subagent definition, including the built-in Explore and Plan subagents, and Claude can’t pass a model when it starts a subagent. Two kinds of subagent still run on the main conversation’s model:
A
fork
A
skill that runs in a subagent
with
model: inherit
When you set only
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE
, the built-in Explore subagent keeps its
model cap
.
​
Control subagent capabilities
You can control what subagents can do through tool access, permission modes, and conditional rules.
​
Available tools
Subagents inherit the
built-in tools
and MCP tools available in the main conversation, narrowed by two filters: the first removes a short list of tools from every subagent, and the second reduces the built-in tool set for subagents that run in the
background
, which is the default. On macOS, Linux, and WSL, a subagent can also receive the Glob and Grep tools when the main conversation doesn’t have them, as described under
Glob tool behavior
.
Forks
skip both filters and receive the main conversation’s exact tool pool. The first filter removes these tools, even when listed in the
tools
field:
Agent
, when the subagent is at the
depth limit
; in a
fork
the tool stays listed but returns an error instead of spawning
AskUserQuestion
EndConversation
, which can end only the main conversation; see
EndConversation tool behavior
EnterPlanMode
ExitPlanMode
, unless the subagent’s
permissionMode
is
plan
ScheduleWakeup
TaskOutput
WaitForMcpServers
Workflow
The second filter applies to subagents running in the background. Apart from
Agent
and
ExitPlanMode
, which follow the first filter’s conditions wherever the subagent runs, a background subagent keeps every MCP tool but only these built-in tools:
Read
,
Grep
,
Glob
,
Bash
,
PowerShell
,
Edit
,
Write
,
NotebookEdit
,
WebFetch
,
WebSearch
,
TodoWrite
,
Skill
,
ToolSearch
,
EnterWorktree
,
ExitWorktree
,
Monitor
,
TaskStop
,
SendMessage
, and
Artifact
, plus
SubagentHandback
for a subagent that reports through it. Claude Code removes every other built-in tool from a background subagent, whether inherited or listed in the
tools
field, so the same definition can resolve to different tools in the foreground and the background. The removal reports no error unless it leaves the
tools
list
resolving to nothing
.
ListAgents
follows these filters like any built-in tool: a foreground subagent inherits it in sessions where cross-session messaging is enabled, and a background subagent doesn’t keep it.
Teammates in
agent teams
additionally keep the task tools and cron tools:
TaskCreate
,
TaskGet
,
TaskList
,
TaskUpdate
,
CronCreate
,
CronDelete
, and
CronList
.
In a
session without the Task tools
, Claude Code doesn’t provide the task tools to subagents either, even when the subagent runs a different model. An in-process teammate follows your session the same way, while a teammate in its own
split pane
runs as a separate Claude Code process, so its own model decides.
To restrict tools, use the
tools
field as an allowlist or the
disallowedTools
field as a denylist. This example uses
tools
to allow only Read, Grep, Glob, and Bash. The subagent can’t edit files, write files, or use any MCP tools:
---
name
:
safe-researcher
description
:
Research agent with restricted capabilities
tools
:
Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
---
This example uses
disallowedTools
to inherit the subagent’s tool pool except Write and Edit. The subagent keeps Bash, MCP tools, and the rest of its pool:
---
name
:
no-writes
description
:
Inherits the available tools except file writes
disallowedTools
:
Write, Edit
---
If both are set,
disallowedTools
is applied first, then
tools
is resolved against the remaining pool. A tool listed in both is removed.
When nothing in the
tools
list resolves to a tool, for example because every entry is misspelled or names a tool that isn’t available to subagents, Claude Code usually refuses to launch the subagent and the Agent tool returns an error naming the unresolved entries; see
Agent would be spawned with zero tools
for the message and how to fix each entry. Before v2.1.208, that subagent launched with no tools and could return an empty or confusing result.
Both fields accept MCP server-level patterns in addition to exact tool names:
mcp__<server>
or
mcp__<server>__*
grants or removes every tool from the named server. In
disallowedTools
,
mcp__*
also removes every MCP tool from any server. This example removes every tool from the
github
MCP server while keeping tools from other servers and the built-in tools in its pool:
---
name
:
local-only
description
:
Inherits every tool except those from the github MCP server
disallowedTools
:
mcp__github
---
A
disallowedTools
entry with a specifier, such as
Bash(git push *)
, still removes the whole tool from the subagent, not only the matching commands. To keep Bash and block specific commands, add a
Bash deny rule
such as
Bash(git push *)
to
permissions.deny
in your settings. The rule applies to the main conversation and to subagents.
​
Restrict which subagents can be spawned
When an agent runs as the main thread with
claude --agent
, it can spawn subagents using the Agent tool. To restrict which subagent types it can spawn, use
Agent(agent_type)
syntax in the
tools
field.
In version 2.1.63, the Task tool was renamed to Agent. Existing
Task(...)
references in settings and agent definitions still work as aliases.
---
name
:
coordinator
description
:
Coordinates work across specialized agents
tools
:
Agent(worker, researcher), Read, Bash
---
This is an allowlist: only the
worker
and
researcher
subagents can be spawned. If the agent tries to spawn any other type, the request fails and the agent sees only the allowed types in its prompt. To block specific agents while allowing all others, use
permissions.deny
instead.
To allow spawning any subagent without restrictions, use
Agent
without parentheses:
tools
:
Agent, Read, Bash
If you omit
Agent
from the
tools
list entirely, the agent can’t spawn any subagents with the Agent tool.
The
Agent(agent_type)
allowlist syntax applies only to an agent running as the main thread with
claude --agent
. In a subagent definition, listing
Agent
in
tools
lets that subagent spawn subagents of its own while the
depth limit
allows it, but any type list inside the parentheses is ignored.
​
Scope MCP servers to a subagent
Use the
mcpServers
field to give a subagent access to
MCP
servers that aren’t available in the main conversation. Inline servers defined here are connected when the subagent starts, subject to the
trust rule for the agent file’s folder
, and disconnected when it finishes. String references share the parent session’s connection.
The
mcpServers
field applies in both contexts where an agent file can run:
As a subagent, spawned through the Agent tool or an @-mention
As the main session, launched with
--agent
or the
agent
setting
When the agent is the main session, inline server definitions connect at startup alongside servers from
.mcp.json
and settings files, under the same
trust rule for the agent file’s folder
. In
/mcp
, a remote (HTTP or SSE) server you’ve used before can show the
cached
status
instead; Claude Code connects it when Claude first calls one of its tools.
Each entry in the list is either an inline server definition or a string referencing an MCP server already configured in your session:
---
name
:
browser-tester
description
:
Tests features in a real browser using Playwright
mcpServers
:
# Inline definition: scoped to this subagent only
-
playwright
:
type
:
stdio
command
:
npx
args
: [
"-y"
,
"@playwright/mcp@latest"
]
# Reference by name: reuses an already-configured server
-
github
---
Use the Playwright tools to navigate, screenshot, and interact with pages.
Inline definitions use the same schema as
.mcp.json
server entries, keyed by the server name, and support the
stdio
,
http
,
sse
, and
ws
types.
To keep an MCP server out of the main conversation entirely and avoid its tool descriptions consuming context there, define it inline here rather than in
.mcp.json
. The subagent gets the tools; the parent conversation doesn’t.
Claude Code loads an inline server from an agent file in your project’s
.claude/agents/
directory, or in an
--add-dir
directory’s
.claude/agents/
, only after you
trust the folder the agent file came from
. Before v2.1.238, Claude Code loaded these servers without checking trust.
Trust that doesn’t count
: a parent folder’s trust, and the automatic trust a
-p
or SDK session gets for
hooks in settings files
Until then
: Claude Code skips every inline server in that agent file and writes the exact
projects["<path>"].hasTrustDialogAccepted
key for
~/.claude.json
to the debug log
--add-dir
directories
: a directory outside your trusted workspace’s repository needs its own trust entry, since its
.claude/agents/
files don’t inherit your workspace’s trust
Claude Code loads two kinds of server without checking trust for the folder the agent file came from:
A name that references a server you already configured
An inline server in an agent file from
~/.claude/agents/
, in one you pass with
--agents
or the SDK
agents
option, or in one that managed settings supplies
As of v2.1.153, the MCP restrictions that apply to the main session also cover servers declared in subagent frontmatter:
--strict-mcp-config
and
--bare
Enterprise managed MCP configuration
allowedMcpServers
and
deniedMcpServers
policies
When one of these blocks a server, Claude Code skips it and shows a warning naming the blocked servers.
Managed-settings restrictions apply to every subagent regardless of how it is defined.
--strict-mcp-config
doesn’t filter servers you pass inline via
--agents
or the SDK
agents
option, since those are explicit caller input.
​
Permission modes
Set
permissionMode
to choose the permission mode a subagent runs in. Use the modes’ config values, so Manual mode is
default
. If you leave it unset, the subagent inherits the main conversation’s mode, which starts as
auto mode
on Pro, Max, and Team plans unless your settings or your organization change it.
The main conversation’s permission mode decides whether Claude Code uses the value you set:
When the main conversation is in
bypassPermissions
,
acceptEdits
, or
auto mode
, the subagent runs in that same mode and Claude Code ignores the
permissionMode
you set. Under auto mode, the classifier evaluates the subagent’s tool calls with the main conversation’s block and allow rules. When the subagent finishes, the classifier also reviews its work and its final report before the report is delivered, as
How auto mode handles subagents
describes.
When the main conversation is in
default
,
dontAsk
, or
plan
mode, the subagent runs in the permission mode you set, except
bypassPermissions
. A subagent that declares
bypassPermissions
keeps the main conversation’s mode instead. The
bypassPermissions
exception requires Claude Code v2.1.267 or later.
permissionMode
accepts these values, and
manual
as an alias for
default
:
Mode
Behavior
default
Manual mode: prompts for permission
acceptEdits
Auto-accept file edits and common filesystem commands for paths in the working directory or
additionalDirectories
auto
Auto mode
: a background classifier reviews commands and protected-directory writes
dontAsk
Auto-deny permission prompts. Explicitly allowed tools still work;
AskUserQuestion
, MCP tools marked
requiresUserInteraction
, and connector tools
your organization set to
ask
in sessions where that setting reaches Claude Code are denied even if you’ve allowed them
bypassPermissions
Skip permission prompts
. A subagent runs in this mode only when the main conversation does
plan
Plan mode (read-only exploration)
​
Preload skills into subagents
Use the
skills
field to inject skill content into a subagent’s context at startup. This gives the subagent domain knowledge without requiring it to discover and load skills during execution.
---
name
:
api-developer
description
:
Implement API endpoints following team conventions
skills
:
-
api-conventions
-
error-handling-patterns
---
Implement API endpoints. Follow the conventions and patterns from the preloaded skills.
The full content of each listed skill is injected into the subagent’s context at startup. This field controls which skills are preloaded, not which skills the subagent can access: without it, the subagent can still discover and invoke project, user, and plugin skills through the Skill tool during execution. To prevent a subagent from invoking skills entirely, omit
Skill
from the
tools
list or add it to
disallowedTools
.
You can’t preload skills that set
disable-model-invocation: true
, since preloading draws from the same set of skills Claude can invoke. This includes the bundled
/verify
skill: only you can run it, so it can’t be preloaded either.
If a listed skill is missing or disabled, for example by your organization’s policy, Claude Code skips it and logs a warning to the debug log.
This is the inverse of
running a skill in a subagent
. With
skills
in a subagent, the subagent controls the system prompt and loads skill content. With
context: fork
in a skill, the skill content is injected into the agent you specify. In both cases the subagent starts without your conversation history.
​
Enable persistent memory
The
memory
field gives the subagent a persistent directory that survives across conversations. The subagent uses this directory to build up knowledge over time, such as codebase patterns, debugging insights, and architectural decisions.
---
name
:
code-reviewer
description
:
Reviews code for quality and best practices
memory
:
user
---
You are a code reviewer. As you review code, update your agent memory with
patterns, conventions, and recurring issues you discover.
Choose a scope based on how broadly the memory should apply:
Scope
Location
Use when
user
~/.claude/agent-memory/<name-of-agent>/
the subagent should remember learnings across all projects
project
.claude/agent-memory/<name-of-agent>/
the subagent’s knowledge is project-specific and shareable via version control
local
.claude/agent-memory-local/<name-of-agent>/
the subagent’s knowledge is project-specific but shouldn’t be checked into version control
Subagent memory is part of
auto memory
: if you turn auto memory off, with the
autoMemoryEnabled
setting or
CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY
, the
memory
field has no effect and the subagent launches without the memory instructions or the memory tool access described below.
When memory is enabled:
The subagent’s system prompt includes instructions for reading and writing to the memory directory.
The subagent’s system prompt also includes the first 200 lines or 25KB of
MEMORY.md
in the memory directory, whichever comes first, with instructions to curate
MEMORY.md
if it exceeds that limit.
Read, Write, and Edit tools are automatically enabled so the subagent can manage its memory files.
Persistent memory tips
project
is the recommended default scope. It makes subagent knowledge shareable via version control.
Ask the subagent to consult its memory before starting work: “Review this PR, and check your memory for patterns you’ve seen before.”
Ask the subagent to update its memory after completing a task: “Now that you’re done, save what you learned to your memory.” Over time, this builds a knowledge base that makes the subagent more effective.
Include memory instructions directly in the subagent’s markdown file so it proactively maintains its own knowledge base:
Update your agent memory as you discover codepaths, patterns, library
locations, and key architectural decisions. This builds up institutional
knowledge across conversations. Write concise notes about what you found
and where.
​
Conditional rules with hooks
For more dynamic control over tool usage, use
PreToolUse
hooks to validate operations before they execute. This is useful when you need to allow some operations of a tool while blocking others.
This example creates a subagent that only allows read-only database queries. The
PreToolUse
hook runs the script specified in
command
before each Bash command executes:
---
name
:
db-reader
description
:
Execute read-only database queries
tools
:
Bash
hooks
:
PreToolUse
:
-
matcher
:
"Bash"
hooks
:
-
type
:
command
command
:
"./scripts/validate-readonly-query.sh"
---
Claude Code
passes hook input as JSON
via stdin to hook commands. The validation script reads this JSON, extracts the Bash command, and
exits with code 2
to block write operations:
#!/bin/bash
# ./scripts/validate-readonly-query.sh
INPUT
=
$(
cat
)
COMMAND
=
$(
echo
"
$INPUT
"
|
jq
-r
'.tool_input.command // empty'
)
# Block SQL write operations (case-insensitive)
if
echo
"
$COMMAND
"
|
grep
-iE
'\b(INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|DROP|CREATE|ALTER|TRUNCATE)\b'
>
/dev/null
;
then
echo
"Blocked: Only SELECT queries are allowed"
>&2
exit
2
fi
exit
0
On macOS and Linux, make the script executable, or the hook fails instead of blocking anything:
chmod
+x
./scripts/validate-readonly-query.sh
To test the rule, ask the subagent to run an
UPDATE
statement: the script exits with code 2, Claude Code blocks the command, and the subagent sees the
Blocked: Only SELECT queries are allowed
message.
See
Hook input
for the complete input schema and
exit codes
for how exit codes affect behavior. On Windows, write hook scripts in PowerShell and add
shell: powershell
to the hook entry as shown in
running hooks in PowerShell
.
​
Disable specific subagents
You can prevent Claude from using specific subagents by adding them to the
deny
array in your
settings
. Use the format
Agent(subagent-name)
where
subagent-name
matches the subagent’s name field.
{
"permissions"
: {
"deny"
: [
"Agent(Explore)"
,
"Agent(my-custom-agent)"
]
}
}
This works for both built-in and custom subagents. You can also use the
--disallowedTools
CLI flag:
claude
--disallowedTools
"Agent(Explore)"
See
Permissions documentation
for more details on permission rules.
​
Define hooks for subagents
Subagents can define
hooks
that run during the subagent’s lifecycle. There are two ways to configure hooks:
In the subagent’s frontmatter
: define hooks that run only while that subagent is active
In
settings.json
: define session-wide hooks that also fire inside subagents. Tool events such as
PreToolUse
and
PostToolUse
fire for the subagent’s tool calls the same way they do in the main conversation, and
SubagentStart
and
SubagentStop
fire when a subagent starts or finishes
Hooks from
settings files, managed policy settings, and plugins
all apply inside subagents, so a
PreToolUse
hook in
settings.json
also runs before every tool a subagent uses.
​
Hooks in subagent frontmatter
Define hooks directly in the subagent’s markdown file. These hooks only run while that specific subagent is active and are cleaned up when it finishes.
Frontmatter hooks fire when the agent is spawned as a subagent through the Agent tool or an @-mention, and when the agent runs as the main session via
--agent
or the
agent
setting. In the main-session case they run alongside any hooks defined in
settings.json
.
To let a project-level subagent’s frontmatter hooks run, accept the
workspace trust dialog
for the folder that contains the agent file. Hooks from user-level subagents in
~/.claude/agents/
and from definitions you pass with
--agents
run without this step. If you added a folder with
--add-dir
from outside your trusted workspace’s repository, trust that folder separately: its
.claude/agents/
hooks don’t inherit the workspace’s grant.
Until you trust the folder, the subagent still runs, but Claude Code skips its frontmatter hooks and logs an error to the debug log explaining how to trust the folder. This is a stricter rule than the one for hooks in settings files: trusting a parent folder isn’t enough, and a
-p
session doesn’t count as trusted.
What runs before you trust a folder
compares the two. Before v2.1.218, frontmatter hooks could run from folders you hadn’t trusted, including in non-interactive sessions.
All
hook events
are supported. The most common events for subagents are:
Event
Matcher input
When it fires
PreToolUse
Tool name
Before the subagent uses a tool
PostToolUse
Tool name
After the subagent uses a tool
Stop
(none)
When the subagent finishes (converted to
SubagentStop
at runtime)
This example validates Bash commands with the
PreToolUse
hook and runs a linter after file edits with
PostToolUse

For a quickstart guide with examples, see
Automate actions with hooks
.
Hooks are user-defined shell commands, HTTP endpoints, MCP tool calls, LLM prompts, or subagents that execute automatically at specific points in Claude Code’s lifecycle. Claude Code fires the same hook events wherever it runs: sessions in the terminal, IDE extensions, the
Desktop app
, and
cloud sessions
. Use this reference to look up event schemas, configuration options, JSON input/output formats, and advanced features like async hooks, HTTP hooks, and MCP tool hooks.
​
Hook lifecycle
Claude Code runs hooks at specific points during a session. When an event fires and a matcher matches, Claude Code passes JSON context about the event to your hook handler. For command hooks, input arrives on stdin. For HTTP hooks, it arrives as the POST request body. Your handler can then inspect the input, take action, and optionally return a decision.
Events fall into three cadences:
per session:
SessionStart
and
SessionEnd
per turn:
UserPromptSubmit
,
Stop
, and
StopFailure
on every tool call inside the agentic loop:
PreToolUse
and
PostToolUse
, except
EndConversation
calls, which skip both
The table below summarizes when each event fires. The
Hook events
section documents the full input schema and decision control options for each one.
Event
When it fires
SessionStart

Setup
When you start Claude Code with
--init-only
, or with

UserPromptSubmit
When you submit a prompt, before Claude processes it
UserPromptExpansion
When a user-typed command expands into a prompt, before it reaches Claude. Can block the expansion
PreToolUse
Before a tool call executes. Can block it
PermissionRequest
When a tool call needs a permission decision
PermissionDenied
When auto mode denies a tool call, including denials without a classifier verdict. Use JSON
hookSpecificOutput.retry: true
to tell the model it may retry the denied tool call. Claude Code ignores
retry
when the classifier produced no verdict

file is loaded into context. Fires at session start and when files are lazily loaded during a session
ConfigChange
When a configuration file changes during a session
CwdChanged
When the working directory changes, for example when Claude executes a
cd
command. Useful for reactive environment management with tools like direnv
DirectoryAdded

WorktreeRemove
When a worktree is being removed at session exit, when a subagent finishes, or when you delete a background session
PreCompact
Before context compaction
PostCompact
After context compaction completes
PreModelSwitch
Before Claude Code applies a model switch that you or a client requested. Can block the switch
PostModelSwitch
After the session’s model changes, including changes Claude Code makes on its own, such as restoring the model when you resume a session
Elicitation
When an MCP server requests user input during a tool call
ElicitationResult
After a user responds to an MCP elicitation, before the response is sent back to the server
SessionEnd
When a session terminates
​
How a hook resolves
To see how the event, the matcher, and the handler fit together, consider this
PreToolUse
hook that blocks destructive shell commands.
macOS/Linux
Windows (PowerShell)
The
matcher
narrows to Bash tool calls and the
if
condition narrows further to Bash subcommands matching
rm *
, so
block-rm.sh
only spawns when both filters match:
{
"hooks"
: {
"PreToolUse"
: [
{
"matcher"
:
"Bash"
,
"hooks"
: [
{
"type"
:
"command"
,
"if"
:
"Bash(rm *)"
,
"command"
:
"${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/block-rm.sh"
,
"args"
: []
}
]
}
]
}
}
The script reads the JSON input from stdin, extracts the command, and returns a
permissionDecision
of
"deny"
if it contains
rm -rf
. Save it to
.claude/hooks/block-rm.sh
in your project and make it executable with
chmod +x .claude/hooks/block-rm.sh
so Claude Code can run it:
#!/bin/bash
# .claude/hooks/block-rm.sh
COMMAND
=
$(
jq
-r
'.tool_input.command'
)
if
echo
"
$COMMAND
"
|
grep
-q
'rm -rf'
;
then
jq
-n
'{
hookSpecificOutput: {
hookEventName: "PreToolUse",
permissionDecision: "deny",
permissionDecisionReason: "Destructive command blocked by hook"
}
}'
else
exit
0
# no decision; normal permission flow applies
fi
This script, like the other Bash examples on this page that parse JSON input, uses
jq
, so install
jq
and make sure it is on your
PATH
before trying them.
The matcher
Bash|PowerShell
covers the
PowerShell tool
as well as Bash. A single
if
rule matches only one tool’s calls, so each tool gets its own handler: the first narrows to Bash subcommands matching
rm *
, the second to PowerShell commands matching
Remove-Item *
. Both run the same script through
powershell.exe
:
{
"hooks"
: {
"PreToolUse"
: [
{
"matcher"
:
"Bash|PowerShell"
,
"hooks"
: [
{
"type"
:
"command"
,
"if"
:
"Bash(rm *)"
,
"command"
:
"powershell.exe"
,
"args"
: [
"-NoProfile"
,
"-ExecutionPolicy"
,
"Bypass"
,
"-File"
,
"${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/block-rm.ps1"
]
},
{
"type"
:
"command"
,
"if"
:
"PowerShell(Remove-Item *)"
,
"command"
:
"powershell.exe"
,
"args"
: [
"-NoProfile"
,
"-ExecutionPolicy"
,
"Bypass"
,
"-File"
,
"${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/block-rm.ps1"
]
}
]
}
]
}
}
The
-NoProfile
flag skips loading your PowerShell profile so the hook starts fast, and
-ExecutionPolicy Bypass
lets PowerShell run the local script file.
The script reads the JSON input from stdin, extracts the command, and returns a
permissionDecision
of
"deny"
if it contains
rm -rf
or
Remove-Item
followed by
-Recurse
. Save it to
.claude/hooks/block-rm.ps1
in your project:
# .claude/hooks/block-rm.ps1
$callInput
=
[
Console
]::
In
.ReadToEnd()
|
ConvertFrom-Json
$command
=
$callInput
.tool_input.command
if
(
$command
-match
'rm -rf|Remove-Item.*-Recurse'
) {
@
{
hookSpecificOutput
=
@
{
hookEventName
=
"PreToolUse"
permissionDecision
=
"deny"
permissionDecisionReason
=
"Destructive command blocked by hook"
}
}
|
ConvertTo-Json
}
else
{
exit
0
# no decision; normal permission flow applies
}
Now suppose Claude Code decides to run
Bash "rm -rf /tmp/build"
against the macOS/Linux config. Here’s what happens:
1
Event fires
The
PreToolUse
event fires. Claude Code sends the tool input as JSON on stdin to the hook:
{
"tool_name"
:
"Bash"
,
"tool_input"
: {
"command"
:
"rm -rf /tmp/build"
},
...
}
2
Matcher checks
The matcher
"Bash"
matches the tool name, so this hook group activates. If you omit the matcher or use
"*"
, the group activates on every occurrence of the event.
3
If condition checks
The
if
condition
"Bash(rm *)"
matches because
rm -rf /tmp/build
is a subcommand matching
rm *
, so this handler spawns. If the command had been
npm test
, the
if
check would fail and
block-rm.sh
would never run, avoiding the process spawn overhead. The
if
field is optional; without it, every handler in the matched group runs.
4
Hook handler runs
The script inspects the full command and finds
rm -rf
, so it prints a decision to stdout:
{
"hookSpecificOutput"
: {
"hookEventName"
:
"PreToolUse"
,
"permissionDecision"
:
"deny"
,
"permissionDecisionReason"
:
"Destructive command blocked by hook"
}
}
If the command had been a safer
rm
variant like
rm file.txt
, the script would hit
exit 0
instead. Exit code 0 with no output means the hook has no decision to report, so the tool call continues through the normal
permission flow
. The hook can deny the call, but staying silent doesn’t approve it.
5
Claude Code acts on the result
Claude Code reads the JSON decision, blocks the tool call, and shows Claude the reason.
The
Configuration
section below documents the full schema, and each
hook event
section documents what input your command receives and what output it can return.
​
Configuration
Hooks are defined in JSON settings files. The configuration has three levels of nesting:
Choose a
hook event
to respond to, like
PreToolUse
or
Stop
Add a
matcher group
to filter when it fires, like “only for the Bash tool”
Define one or more
hook handlers
to run when matched
See
How a hook resolves
above for a complete walkthrough with an annotated example.
This page uses specific terms for each level:
hook event
for the lifecycle point,
matcher group
for the filter, and
hook handler
for the shell command, HTTP endpoint, MCP tool, prompt, or agent that runs. “Hook” on its own refers to the general feature.

While that subagent is running
Yes, defined in the subagent file
Cloud sessions
don’t read your local
~/.claude/settings.json
; hooks there come from the repo, meaning its
.claude/settings.json
in a session with one repository and the plugins it declares in any session, and from your organization’s server-managed settings. In a
self-hosted environment
, Claude Code also runs the hooks the operator seeded from the runner host’s
~/.claude/
, and it runs the hooks in the runner image’s managed settings file when that file is among the
managed sources Claude Code applies
, which by default means only when neither server-managed settings nor an MDM-delivered Claude Code policy supplies the managed tier. See
what carries over from your setup
for which files reach a cloud session.
For details on settings file resolution, see
settings
.
Hooks from settings files, managed policy settings, and plugins also run inside
subagents
. When a subagent calls a tool, tool events such as
PreToolUse
and
PostToolUse
fire the same configured hooks as in the main conversation, and the input carries the
agent_id
and
agent_type
common input fields
that identify the subagent.
Enterprise administrators can use
allowManagedHooksOnly
to restrict which hooks run:
Your user, project, local, and plugin hooks are blocked. Hooks from plugins force-enabled in managed settings
enabledPlugins
are exempt
Claude Code also narrows your
statusLine
,
fileSuggestion
, and
subagentStatusLine
settings to managed settings
Claude Code also disables plugins with a
command
source
, including plugins force-enabled in managed settings
enabledPlugins
, unless
disableCommandPluginSources
is explicitly set to
false
.
command
sources require Claude Code v2.1.229 or later
Claude Code also blocks marketplace
headersHelper
commands
unless
disableCommandPluginSources
is explicitly set to
false
, except for a marketplace that managed settings themselves declare
See
what runs under
allowManagedHooksOnly
.
Hook entries merge across settings levels rather than replacing each other: user, project, and local settings add their own hooks without removing managed ones, and the
disableAllHooks
setting can’t disable managed hooks from outside managed settings.
The
HTTP hook allowlists
apply to hooks from every source, including managed policy settings:
allowedHttpHookUrls
: when defined at any settings level, Claude Code runs an HTTP hook handler only if its URL matches the merged allowlist
httpHookAllowedEnvVars
: when defined, Claude Code interpolates only the environment variables on that list into hook headers
​
Matcher patterns
The
matcher
field filters when hooks fire. How a matcher is evaluated depends on the characters it contains:
Matcher value
Evaluated as
Example
"*"
,
""
, or omitted
Match all
fires on every occurrence of the event
Only letters, digits,
_
,
-
, spaces,
,
, and
|
Exact string, or list of exact strings separated by
|
or
,
with optional surrounding whitespace
Bash
matches only the Bash tool;
Edit|Write
and
Edit, Write
each match either tool exactly;
code-reviewer
matches only that agent type
Contains any other character
JavaScript regular expression, unanchored
^Notebook
matches any tool whose name starts with
Notebook
;
mcp__memory__.*
matches every tool from the
memory
server
A matcher on the regular-expression path is tested with JavaScript’s
RegExp.prototype.test
, which succeeds on a match anywhere in the value.
Edit.*
matches both
Edit
and
NotebookEdit
; wrap the pattern in
^
and
$
, as in
^Edit$
, when you need a whole-string match.
Comma separators and the surrounding whitespace tolerance require Claude Code v2.1.191 or later.
Hyphens in the exact-match set require Claude Code v2.1.195 or later. On earlier versions a hyphenated name like
code-reviewer
is evaluated as an unanchored regular expression, so it also fires for
senior-code-reviewer
; anchor it as
^code-reviewer$
on those versions to match only that name.
FileChanged
and
StopFailure
use a narrower exact-match set of letters, digits,
_
, and
|
only. A hyphen, space, or comma in a matcher for those two events keeps it on the regular-expression path, and only
|
separates alternatives. Every other event with matcher support in the table that follows accepts
|
or
,
.
The
FileChanged
event doesn’t follow these rules when building its watch list. See
FileChanged
.

Matching
StopFailure
on
cloud_credential_error
requires Claude Code v2.1.267 or later, the first version that reports credential-load failures under that value rather than
server_error
or
unknown
.
For most events, Claude Code evaluates the matcher against a field from the
JSON input
it sends to your hook on stdin. For tool events, that field is
tool_name
. For
PreModelSwitch
and
PostModelSwitch
, Claude Code evaluates the matcher against the canonical name it derives from
to_model
, as described under
PreModelSwitch
. Each
hook event
section lists the full set of matcher values and the input schema for that event.
This example runs a linting script only when Claude writes or edits a file:
{
"hooks"
: {
"PostToolUse"
: [
{
"matcher"
:
"Edit|Write"
,
"hooks"
: [
{
"type"
:
"command"
,
"command"
:
"/path/to/lint-check.sh"
}
]
}
]
}
}
If you add a
matcher
field to an event without matcher support, it is silently ignored.
For tool events, you can filter more narrowly by setting the
if
field
on individual hook handlers.
if
uses
permission rule syntax
to match against the tool name and arguments together, so
"Bash(git *)"
runs when any subcommand of the Bash input matches
git *
and
"Edit(*.ts)"
runs only for TypeScript files.
​
Match MCP tools
MCP
server tools appear as regular tools in tool events (
PreToolUse
,
PostToolUse
,
PostToolUseFailure
,
PermissionRequest
,
PermissionDenied
), so you can match them the same way you match any other tool name.
MCP tools follow the naming pattern
mcp__<server>__<tool>
, for example:
mcp__memory__create_entities
: Memory server’s create entities tool
mcp__filesystem__read_file
: Filesystem server’s read file tool
mcp__github__search_repositories
: GitHub server’s search tool
To match every tool from a server, append
.*
to the server prefix. The
.*
is required: a matcher like
mcp__memory
or
mcp__brave-search
contains only exact-match characters, so it is compared as an exact string and matches no tool.
mcp__memory__.*
matches all tools from the
memory
server
mcp__brave-search__.*
matches all tools from a server whose name contains a hyphen
mcp__.*__write.*
matches any tool whose name starts with
write
from any server
Hyphens in the exact-match set require Claude Code v2.1.195 or later. On earlier versions a bare hyphenated prefix like
mcp__brave-search
is evaluated as an unanchored regular expression and matches every tool from that server. The
mcp__brave-search__.*
form works on every version.
Tools from a
plugin-bundled MCP server
use a scoped server segment that includes the plugin name:
mcp__plugin_<plugin-name>_<server-name>__<tool>
. A matcher written against the bare server key never fires for these tools. For a plugin named
my-plugin
that bundles a server under the key
db
, a
query
tool appears as
mcp__plugin_my-plugin_db__query
, so the matcher for every tool from that server is
mcp__plugin_my-plugin_db__.*
. Use the same scoped tool name in a handler’s
if
field
. See
Plugin-provided MCP servers
for how the scoped name is built.
This example logs all memory server operations and validates write operations from any MCP server:
{
"hooks"
: {
"PreToolUse"
: [
{
"matcher"
:
"mcp__memory__.*"
,
"hooks"
: [
{
"type"
:
"command"
,
"command"
:
"echo 'Memory operation initiated' >> ~/mcp-operations.log"
}
]
},
{
"matcher"
:
"mcp__.*__write.*"
,
"hooks"
: [
{
"type"
:
"command"
,
"command"
:
"/home/user/scripts/validate-mcp-write.py"
}
]
}
]
}
}
​
Hook handler fields
Each object in the inner
hooks
array is a hook handler: the shell command, HTTP endpoint, MCP tool, LLM prompt, or agent that runs when the matcher matches. There are five types:
Command hooks
(
type: "command"
): run a shell command. Your script receives the event’s
JSON input
on stdin and communicates results back through exit codes and stdout.
HTTP hooks
(
type: "http"
): send the event’s JSON input as an HTTP POST request to a URL. The endpoint communicates results back through the response body using the same
JSON output format
as command hooks.
MCP tool hooks
(
type: "mcp_tool"
): call a tool on an already-connected
MCP server
. The tool’s text output is treated like command-hook stdout.
Prompt hooks
(
type: "prompt"
): send a prompt to a Claude model for single-turn evaluation. The model returns its decision as JSON. See
Prompt-based hooks
.
Agent hooks
(
type: "agent"
): spawn a subagent that can use tools like Read, Grep, and Glob to verify conditions before returning a decision. Agent hooks are experimental and may change. See
Agent-based hooks
.
All matching hooks run in parallel. If you define the same handler in more than one settings file, it runs once. A plugin’s or skill’s copy of the same handler stays separate.
Handlers run in the current directory with Claude Code’s environment. If the current directory no longer exists, for example a worktree or temp directory that another shell deleted mid-session, Claude Code runs command hooks from the first of these that still exists: the directory the session started in, the project root, your home directory, or the system temp directory. Claude Code records a warning naming the fallback directory in the
debug log
.
The
$CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE
environment variable is
"true"
in remote web environments and not set in the local CLI. Claude Code v2.1.199 and later sets
$CLAUDE_CODE_BRIDGE_SESSION_ID
to the
Remote Control
session ID while the local session has an active Remote Control connection.
​
Common fields
These fields apply to all hook types:
Field
Required
Description
type
yes
"command"
,
"http"
,
"mcp_tool"
,
"prompt"
, or
"agent"
if
no
Permission rule syntax to filter when this hook runs, such as
"Bash(git *)"
or
"Edit(*.ts)"
. The hook command only runs if the tool call matches the pattern. See the
Bash matching table
below for how Bash patterns evaluate against subcommands,
$()
, and backticks. Only evaluated on tool events:
PreToolUse
,
PostToolUse
,
PostToolUseFailure
,
PermissionRequest
, and
PermissionDenied
. On other events, a hook with
if
set never runs. Uses the same syntax as
permission rules
timeout
no
Seconds before canceling. Claude Code doesn’t enforce it on a command hook you run with
async: true
. Defaults: 600 for
command
,
http
, and
mcp_tool
; 30 for
prompt
; 60 for
agent
. Claude Code lowers the
command
,
http
, and
mcp_tool
default to 30 on
UserPromptSubmit
,
PreModelSwitch
, and
PostModelSwitch
, and to 10 on
MessageDisplay
.
SessionEnd
hooks share a 1.5-second budget; if your settings set a longer per-hook
timeout
, Claude Code raises the budget to match, up to 60 seconds
statusMessage
no
Custom spinner message displayed while the hook runs
once
no
If
true
, Claude Code removes the hook after its first successful run. A run that fails, blocks with exit code 2, or times out leaves the hook in place, so it runs again on the next matching event. Only honored for hooks declared in
skill frontmatter
; ignored in settings files and agent frontmatter
The
if
field holds exactly one permission rule. There is no
&&
,
||
, or list syntax for combining rules; to apply multiple conditions, define a separate hook handler for each.
In an
if
condition for a file tool, a single-segment directory pattern like
"Edit(src/**)"
matches only the
src
directory in the working directory and the files under it. To match a directory named
src
at any depth, write
"Edit(**/src/**)"
. Before v2.1.214,
"Edit(src/**)"
matched a directory named
src
at any depth under the working directory.
For Bash patterns, whether your hook command runs depends on the shape of the pattern and the Bash command Claude is invoking. Leading
VAR=value
assignments are stripped before matching.
if
pattern
Bash command
Hook runs?
Why
Bash(git *)
FOO=bar git push

Bash(rm *)
echo $(rm -rf /)

rm -rf /

Bash(rm *)
echo $(date)
no
no subcommand matches
rm *
Bash(cat *)
echo before $(date) after
no
a substitution can sit at any argument position, so the full command and
date
are both checked; neither matches
cat *
Bash(git *)
$TOOL git push
yes
Claude Code can’t tell what the command name expands to, so it runs the hook
Bash(git push *)
echo $(date)
yes
patterns that specify more than the command name run the hook anyway on
$()
, backticks, or
$VAR
When Claude Code can’t determine which commands the Bash input runs, it runs your hook regardless of the pattern. Because the
if
filter is best-effort, use the
permission system
rather than a hook to enforce a hard allow or deny.
​
Command hook fields
In addition to the
common fields
, command hooks accept these fields:
Field
Required
Description
command
yes
Shell command to execute. With
args
, the executable to spawn directly. See
Exec form and shell form
args
no
Argument list. When present,
command
is resolved as an executable and spawned directly with
args
as the argument vector, with no shell involved. See
Exec form and shell form
async
no
If
true
, runs in the background without blocking. See
Run hooks in the background
asyncRewake
no
If
true
, runs in the background and wakes Claude on exit code 2. The hook’s stderr, or stdout if stderr is empty, is shown to Claude as a system reminder so it can react to a long-running background failure
shell
no
Shell to use for this hook. Accepts
"bash"
or
"powershell"
. Defaults to
"bash"
, or to
"powershell"
on Windows when Git Bash isn’t installed. Setting
"powershell"
runs the command via PowerShell on Windows. Does not require
CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL
since hooks spawn PowerShell directly. Ignored when
args
is set
Exec form and shell form
A command hook runs as exec form when
args
is set, and shell form when
args
is omitted. Set
args
whenever the hook references a
path placeholder
, since each element is passed as one argument with no quoting. Omit
args
when you need shell features like pipes or
&&
, or when neither concern applies.
Exec form
runs when
args
is present. Claude Code resolves
command
as an executable on
PATH
and spawns it directly with
args
as the argument vector. There is no shell, so each
args
element is one argument exactly as written, and path placeholders like
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
are substituted into
command
and into each
args
element as plain strings. Special characters such as apostrophes,
$
, and backticks pass through verbatim because there is no shell to interpret them. No shell tokenization happens on any platform.
Shell form
runs when
args
is absent. The
command
string is passed to a shell:
sh -c
on macOS and Linux, Git Bash on Windows, or PowerShell when Git Bash isn’t installed. Set the
shell
field to choose explicitly. The shell tokenizes the string, expands variables, and interprets pipes,
&&
, redirects, and globs.
On Windows, exec form requires
command
to resolve to a real executable such as a
.exe
. The
.cmd
and
.bat
shims that npm, npx, eslint, and other tools install in
node_modules/.bin
are not executables and can’t be spawned without a shell. To run them in exec form, invoke the underlying script with
node
directly, for example
"command": "node", "args": ["${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js"]
. The
node
plus script-path pattern works on every platform because
node.exe
is a real binary. To run a
.cmd
or
.bat
shim by name, use shell form.
This example runs a Node script bundled with a plugin. Exec form passes the resolved script path as one argument with no quoting:
{
"type"
:
"command"
,
"command"
:
"node"
,
"args"
: [
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/format.js"
,
"--fix"
]
}
The equivalent shell form needs quoting to handle paths with spaces or special characters:
{
"type"
:
"command"
,
"command"
:
"node
\"
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
\"
/scripts/format.js --fix"
}
Both forms support the same
path placeholders
, and both export them as the environment variables
CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
,
CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT
, and
CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA
on the spawned process, so a script can read
process.env.CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT
regardless of how it was launched.
Plugin hooks additionally substitute
${user_config.*}
values, in exec form only: the value is substituted into
command
and into each
args
element as a plain string, so no shell re-parses it.
A shell-form plugin hook whose
command
references
${user_config.*}
fails with an
error
instead of running. To use an option value from a shell-form hook, read the
$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_<KEY>
environment variable, such as
$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_WEBHOOK_URL
for a
webhook_url
option, or set
args
to switch the hook to exec form. Before v2.1.207, shell-form plugin hook commands also substituted
${user_config.*}
.
In exec form,
command
is the executable name or path only. If
command
is a bare name with no path separator and contains whitespace alongside
args
, Claude Code logs a warning because the spawn will fail: there is no executable named
node script.js
. Move the extra tokens into
args
. Absolute paths with spaces, such as
C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe
, are a single valid executable and don’t trigger the warning.
​
HTTP hook fields
In addition to the
common fields
, HTTP hooks accept these fields:
Field
Required
Description
url
yes
URL to send the POST request to
headers
no
Additional HTTP headers as key-value pairs. Values support environment variable interpolation using
$VAR_NAME
or
${VAR_NAME}
syntax. Only variables listed in
allowedEnvVars
are resolved
allowedEnvVars
no
List of environment variable names that may be interpolated into header values. References to unlisted variables are replaced with empty strings. Required for any env var interpolation to work
Claude Code sends the hook’s
JSON input
as the POST request body with
Content-Type: application/json
. The response body uses the same
JSON output format
as command hooks.
Error handling differs from command hooks; see
HTTP response handling
.
This example sends
PreToolUse
events to a local validation service, authenticating with a token from the
MY_TOKEN
environment variable:
{
"hooks"
: {
"PreToolUse"
: [
{
"matcher"
:
"Bash"
,
"hooks"
: [
{
"type"
:
"http"
,
"url"
:
"http://localhost:8080/hooks/pre-tool-use"
,
"timeout"
:
30
,
"headers"
: {
"Authorization"
:
"Bearer $MY_TOKEN"
},
"allowedEnvVars"
: [
"MY_TOKEN"
]
}
]
}
]
}
}
​
MCP tool hook fields
In addition to the
common fields
, MCP tool hooks accept these fields:
Field
Required
Description
server
yes
Name of a configured MCP server. For a
plugin-bundled server
, this is the scoped name
plugin:<plugin-name>:<server-name>
, such as
plugin:my-plugin:db
, not the bare server key. The server must already be connected; the hook never triggers an OAuth or connection flow
tool
yes
Name of the tool to call on that server
input
no
Arguments passed to the tool. String values support
${path}
substitution from the hook’s
JSON input
, such as
"${tool_input.file_path}"
Claude Code reads the tool’s text content the same way it reads command-hook stdout, following the
parsing rule under exit code 0
. If the named server is not connected, or the tool returns
isError: true
, the hook produces a non-blocking error and execution continues.
This example calls the
security_scan
tool on the
my_server
MCP server after each
Write
or
Edit
, passing the edited file’s path:
{
"hooks"
: {
"PostToolUse"
: [
{
"matcher"
:
"Write|Edit"
,
"hooks"
: [
{
"type"
:
"mcp_tool"
,
"server"
:
"my_server"
,
"tool"
:
"security_scan"
,
"input"
: {
"file_path"
:
"${tool_input.file_path}"
}
}
]
}
]
}
}
An
mcp_tool
hook can run only once Claude Code has made the session’s MCP servers available to hooks.
SessionStart
and
Setup
can fire before that point:
At launch
:
SessionStart
fires before the servers are available, including when you launch with
--continue
or
--resume
. Claude Code skips the event’s
mcp_tool
hooks without calling their tools, and the
debug log
records
mcp_tool hooks are not available for the 'SessionStart' hook event (no MCP client context)
.
Later in a running session
: after
/clear
or a compaction,
SessionStart
fires again with the servers already available, and its
mcp_tool
hooks run.
On
Setup
:
Setup
always fires before the servers are available, so Claude Code skips its
mcp_tool
hooks every time and records the same message naming
Setup
.
For example, this configuration calls the
load_context
tool on the
my_server
MCP server from a
SessionStart
hook with no matcher, so it applies to every
SessionStart
source:
{
"hooks"
: {
"SessionStart"
: [
{
"hooks"
: [
{
"type"
:
"mcp_tool"
,
"server"
:
"my_server"
,
"tool"
:
"load_context"
}
]
}
]
}
}
When you run
claude
, Claude Code skips this hook, never calls
load_context
, and writes the
no MCP client context
message to the debug log. Run
/clear
in that same session and the hook runs and calls
load_context
. A
type: "command"
hook on
SessionStart
runs at launch, so use one for anything the session needs from its first turn.
​
Prompt and agent hook fields
In addition to the
common fields
, prompt and agent hooks accept these fields:
Field
Required
Description
prompt
yes
Prompt text to send to the model. Use
$ARGUMENTS
as a placeholder for the hook input JSON. Escape with a backslash to include literal text:
\$1.00
renders as
$1.00
model
no
Model to use for evaluation. Defaults to a fast model
​
Reference scripts by path
Use these placeholders to reference hook scripts relative to the project or plugin root, regardless of the working directory when the hook runs:
${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}
: the project root where the session started. Claude Code also sets this variable in the environment of
stdio MCP servers
and plugin LSP servers.
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
: the plugin’s installation directory, for scripts bundled with a
plugin
. See
plugin environment variables
for how the path behaves across updates.
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}
: the plugin’s
persistent data directory
, for dependencies and state that should survive plugin updates.
Worktrees are different.
If Claude enters a
worktree
during the session, Claude Code keeps
${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}
where it was and passes the worktree path to your hooks a different way:
${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}
stays put
: it still points at the project root where the session started, so a command such as
${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/check-style.sh
still runs the script in the main checkout.
cwd
follows Claude
: the
cwd
field in the hook’s
input JSON
is the worktree root after Claude enters a worktree, and the new directory after Claude runs
cd
. Read it when a hook needs to know which directory Claude is working in.
Prefer
exec form
for any hook that references a path placeholder. In shell form, wrap each placeholder in double quotes.
Project scripts
Plugin scripts
This example uses
${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}
to run a style checker from the project’s
.claude/hooks/
directory after any
Write
or
Edit
tool call:
{
"hooks"
: {
"PostToolUse"
: [
{
"matcher"
:
"Write|Edit"
,
"hooks"
: [
{
"type"
:
"command"
,
"command"
:
"${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/check-style.sh"
,
"args"
: []
}
]
}
]
}
}
Define plugin hooks in
hooks/hooks.json
with an optional top-level
description
field. When a plugin is enabled, its hooks merge with your user and project hooks.
This example runs a formatting script bundled with the plugin:
{
"description"
:
"Automatic code formatting"
,
"hooks"
: {
"PostToolUse"
: [
{
"matcher"
:
"Write|Edit"
,
"hooks"
: [
{
"type"
:
"command"
,
"command"
:
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/format.sh"
,
"args"
: [],
"timeout"
:
30
}
]
}
]
}
}

plugin components reference
for details on creating plugin hooks.

Hooks in skills and agents
In addition to settings files and plugins, hooks can be defined directly in
skills
and
subagents
using frontmatter, in the same configuration format as settings-based hooks. How long Claude Code keeps them registered depends on the component:
Subagent hooks
: Claude Code runs them only while that subagent is running and removes them when it finishes. Claude Code converts a
Stop
hook here to
SubagentStop
, the event it fires when a subagent completes.
Skill hooks
: Claude Code registers them when you or Claude invoke the skill and keeps running them for the rest of the session, on turns after the skill’s own turn as well. To have Claude Code remove a hook after its first successful run instead, set
once: true
on it.
This skill defines a
PreToolUse
hook that runs a security validation script before each
Bash
command:
---
name
:
secure-operations
description
:
Perform operations with security checks
hooks
:
PreToolUse
:
-
matcher
:
"Bash"
hooks
:
-
type
:
command
command
:
"./scripts/security-check.sh"
---
Subagents use the same format in their YAML frontmatter.
Frontmatter hooks in a project skill follow the same
workspace trust rule as hooks in settings files
. Claude Code registers them when you or Claude invoke the skill, including in a
-p
run in a folder you haven’t trusted.
Frontmatter hooks in a project subagent run only after you accept the
workspace trust dialog
for the folder the agent file came from. A
-p
session doesn’t count as accepting it.
What runs before you trust a folder
compares this with the settings-file rule, and the subagents page lists
which scopes are exempt
. Before v2.1.218, these hooks could run from folders you hadn’t trusted.
​
The
/hooks
menu
Type
/hooks
in Claude Code to open a read-only browser for your configured hooks. The menu shows every hook event with a count of configured hooks, lets you drill into matchers, and shows the full details of each hook handler. Use it to verify configuration, check which settings file a hook came from, or inspect a hook’s command, prompt, or URL.
The menu displays all five hook types:
command
,
prompt
,
agent
,
http
, and
mcp_tool
. Each hook is labeled with a
[type]
prefix and a source indicating where it was defined:
User Settings
: from
~/.claude/settings.json
Project Settings
: from
.claude/settings.json
Local Settings
: from
.claude/settings.local.json
Plugin Hooks
: from a plugin’s
hooks/hooks.json
Session Hooks
: registered in memory for the current session
Selecting a hook opens a detail view showing its event, matcher, type, source file, and the full command, prompt, or URL. The menu is read-only: to add, modify, or remove hooks, edit the settings JSON directly or ask Claude to make the change.
​
Disable or remove hooks
To remove a hook, delete its entry from the settings JSON file.
To temporarily disable all hooks without removing them, set
"disableAllHooks": true
in your settings file. Claude Code reads the value left after
settings precedence
applies, so a
"disableAllHooks": false
in a project’s
.claude/settings.json
overrides a
true
in your user settings. To turn hooks off for one run whatever the project’s settings say, pass
--settings '{"disableAllHooks": true}'
, which takes precedence over project and local settings. There is no way to disable an individual hook while keeping it in the configuration.
The
disableAllHooks
setting respects the managed settings hierarchy. If an administrator has configured hooks through managed policy settings,
disableAllHooks
set in user, project, or local settings can’t disable those managed hooks. Only
disableAllHooks
set at the managed settings level can disable managed hooks. For the full reach of each level, see
disableAllHooks
.
Direct edits to hooks in settings files are normally picked up automatically by the file watcher.
​
Hook input and output
Command hooks receive JSON data via stdin and communicate results through exit codes, stdout, and stderr. HTTP hooks receive the same JSON as the POST request body and communicate results through the HTTP response body. This section covers fields and behavior common to all events. Each event’s section under
Hook events
includes its specific input schema and decision control options.
On macOS and Linux, command hooks run in their own session without a controlling terminal. The hook process and any child processes can’t open
/dev/tty
or send escape sequences directly to the Claude Code interface. Windows has no
/dev/tty
.
To surface a message to the user on any platform, return
systemMessage
in JSON output. Some events discard it or deliver it elsewhere, and each
event’s section
says so. To trigger a desktop notification, set a window title, or ring the bell, return
terminalSequence
instead.
​
Common input fields
Hook events receive these fields as JSON, in addition to event-specific fields documented in each
hook event
section. For command hooks, this JSON arrives via stdin. For HTTP hooks, it arrives as the POST request body.
Field
Description
session_id
Current session identifier
prompt_id
UUID identifying the user prompt currently being processed. Matches the
prompt.id
attribute on OpenTelemetry events
, so you can correlate hook output with telemetry for a single prompt. Absent until the first user input. Requires Claude Code v2.1.196 or later
transcript_path
Path to conversation JSON. The transcript file is written asynchronously and may lag the in-memory conversation, so it may not yet include the current turn’s most recent messages when a hook fires. Hooks that need the final assistant text of the current turn should use
last_assistant_message
on
Stop
and
SubagentStop
instead of reading the transcript
cwd
Current working directory when the hook is invoked
scratchpad_dir
Path to the session’s scratchpad directory, where Claude keeps temporary working files. Absent when the session has no scratchpad or the temp directory is unavailable. Requires Claude Code v2.1.257 or later
permission_mode
Current
permission mode
:
"default"
,
"plan"
,
"acceptEdits"
,
"auto"
,
"dontAsk"
, or
"bypassPermissions"
. The mode labeled
Manual
arrives as
"default"
, never as
"manual"
, so scripts that match
"default"
keep working. Not all events receive this field. Check the JSON example in each
hook event
section
effort
Object with a
level
field holding the
effort level
in effect when the hook runs:
"low"
,
"medium"
,
"high"
,
"xhigh"
, or
"max"
. If you set a level the active model doesn’t support,
level
reports the level Claude Code ran instead;
Adjust effort level
says how it picks that level. Ultracode is not a distinct level and reports as
"xhigh"
. The object matches the
status line
effort
field. Present for events that fire within a tool-use context, such as
PreToolUse
,
PostToolUse
,
Stop
, and
SubagentStop
, when the current model supports the effort parameter. The level is also available to hook commands and the Bash tool as the
$CLAUDE_EFFORT
environment variable.
hook_event_name
Name of the event that fired
When running with
--agent
or inside a subagent, two additional fields are included:
Field
Description
agent_id
Unique identifier for the subagent. Present only when the hook fires inside a subagent call. Use this to distinguish subagent hook calls from main-thread calls.
agent_type
Agent name (for example,
"Explore"
or
"security-reviewer"
). Present when the session uses
--agent
or the hook fires inside a subagent. For subagents, the subagent’s type takes precedence over the session’s
--agent
value. See
SubagentStart
for the values custom and plugin subagents report and how to write a matcher against a plugin-scoped name.
Only
SessionStart
hooks can receive a
model
field, and Claude Code doesn’t always include it.
PreModelSwitch
and
PostModelSwitch
hooks receive
from_model
and
to_model
instead, so use a PostModelSwitch hook to follow the model as it changes during a session.
There is no
$CLAUDE_MODEL
environment variable. The hook can read
$ANTHROPIC_MODEL
if you set it in your shell, but that value doesn’t change when you switch models with
/model
during a session.
A hook process inherits the parent environment, apart from the
OTEL_*
exporter variables that Claude Code
removes from every subprocess it spawns
and, when
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBPROCESS_ENV_SCRUB
is set to
1
, the variables it strips.
For example, a
PreToolUse
hook for a Bash command receives this on stdin:
{
"session_id"
:
"abc123"
,
"prompt_id"
:
"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
,
"transcript_path"
:
"/home/user/.claude/projects/.../transcript.jsonl"
,
"cwd"
:
"/home/user/my-project"
,
"scratchpad_dir"
:
"/tmp/claude-1000/-home-user-my-project/abc123/scratchpad"
,
"permission_mode"
:
"default"
,
"hook_event_name"
:
"PreToolUse"
,
"tool_name"
:
"Bash"
,
"tool_input"
: {
"command"
:
"npm test"
,
"description"
:
"Run test suite"
,
"timeout"
:
120000
,
"run_in_background"
:
false
},
"tool_use_id"
:
"toolu_01ABC123..."
}
The
tool_name
,
tool_input
, and
tool_use_id
fields are event-specific. Each
hook event
section documents the additional fields for that event.
​
Exit code output
The exit code from your hook command tells Claude Code whether the action should proceed, be blocked, or be ignored. The exit code doesn’t act alone. Claude Code reads
JSON output fields
from stdout on every exit code, not just 0, and for events that use the standard decision model, a parsed object that passes schema validation takes effect alongside the code. Exit 2’s block is the one outcome JSON can’t override.
Two tables own the per-event exceptions:
Exit code 2 behavior per event
says what exit codes do for each event, and
Decision control
says which decision fields each event honors. Universal fields such as
systemMessage
work across most events and are listed in the
JSON output
table.
​
Exit code 0
Exit 0 means success, and is the intended exit code when you print JSON for structured control.
For most events, Claude Code writes stdout to the debug log and doesn’t show it in the transcript. The exceptions are
UserPromptSubmit
,
UserPromptExpansion
,
SessionStart
, and
PostModelSwitch
, where Claude Code adds plain-text stdout as context that Claude can see and act on.
Whether Claude Code reads your stdout as
JSON output
or as plain text depends on how it starts and ends, ignoring surrounding whitespace:
Starts with
{
and ends with
}
: Claude Code parses it as JSON. When the output is two or more lines that each parse as JSON on their own, and no line is a
JSON output
object that sets a field, Claude Code treats the whole output as plain text. When one of those lines does set a field, the whole output is a parse failure, described below.
Starts with
{
but doesn’t end with
}
: Claude Code treats it as plain text.
Starts with anything else
: Claude Code treats it as plain text, a JSON array or a quoted JSON string included.
For events that use the standard decision model, exit 0 with a parsed object that fails schema validation is a non-blocking error: the action proceeds, and the transcript shows a
<hook name> hook error
notice with the validation message. The same happens on any exit code other than 2, while
exit 2 still blocks
.
For events that use the standard decision model, when Claude Code tries to parse your stdout as JSON and can’t, it reports a non-blocking error on every exit code other than 2. The transcript shows a
<hook name> hook error
notice with the parse message. On the events that add plain-text stdout as context, Claude Code doesn’t add the text. Before v2.1.248, Claude Code treated that stdout as plain text.
Stderr from a hook that exits 0 goes to the debug log only, never the transcript, and Claude never sees it. To read it yourself, enable
debug logging
. To surface a warning to Claude from a
PostToolUse
or
PostToolUseFailure
hook, exit 2 instead so
Claude sees the stderr
even though the tool already ran.
​
Exit code 2
Exit 2 means a blocking error. On
events that can block
, exit 2 blocks whether or not you print JSON: even a JSON
permissionDecision
of
"allow"
can’t override it. Claude Code still reads any valid
JSON output
on stdout. On
Elicitation
and
ElicitationResult
, an exit-2 hook’s
hookSpecificOutput
is ignored.
The blocking message is the reason from your JSON’s blocking decision when it makes one, and your stderr text otherwise. What the block does varies by event:
PreToolUse
blocks the tool call,
UserPromptSubmit
rejects the prompt, and so on.
Exit code 2 behavior per event
lists the effect for every event, and each event’s section says where the message goes.
A hook that exits 2 while printing JSON that fails
JSON output
schema validation still blocks: Claude Code uses stderr as the blocking reason and records the validation failure in the debug log. Before v2.1.214, Claude Code treated that combination as a non-blocking error and the action proceeded.
This script blocks
rm
commands by exiting 2 and leaves every other command to the normal permission flow:
#!/bin/bash
# Reads JSON input from stdin, checks the command
input
=
$(
cat
)
command
=
$(
jq
-r
'.tool_input.command'
<<<
"
$input
"
)
if
[[
"
$command
"
==
rm
*
]];
then
echo
"Blocked: rm commands are not allowed"
>&2
exit
2
# Blocking error: tool call is prevented
fi
exit
0
# No decision: the normal permission flow applies
​
Other exit codes
Any other exit code doesn’t block on its own for most hook events. What happens depends on your stdout:
With a parsed object that passes schema validation, for events that use the standard decision model, Claude Code ignores the exit code and the JSON alone decid

Claude Code supports fine-grained permissions so that you can specify exactly what the agent is allowed to do and what it can’t. You can check permission settings into version control to share them with every developer in your organization, and each developer can customize their own.
​
Permission system
Claude Code uses a tiered permission system to balance power and safety. The table shows, for each tool type, whether Manual mode asks before the action runs. The other
permission modes
change which of these ask you; in auto mode a classifier reviews actions instead of you, and
how the classifier evaluates actions
lists which ones it sees.
Tool type
Example
Approval required
”Yes, and don’t ask again” behavior
Read-only
File reads, Grep
No, within the
working directory and additional directories
N/A
Bash commands
Shell execution
Yes, except a built-in set of
read-only commands
Permanently per repository and command
File modification
Edit/write files
Yes
Until session end
Web fetch
WebFetch
Yes, except a built-in set of
preapproved documentation domains
Permanently per repository and domain
Web search
WebSearch
Yes
Permanently per repository
When you choose “Yes, and don’t ask again” and the approval saves permanently, such as for a Bash command or a WebFetch domain, Claude Code saves the rule to
.claude/settings.local.json
at the root of the git repository, resolved through
worktrees
to the main checkout. The rule applies to future sessions anywhere in that repository, including sessions started in subdirectories and in worktrees. A file-modification approval isn’t saved to the file: as the table shows, it lasts until the session ends. In some cases, such as outside a git repository or on Windows, Claude Code doesn’t use the repository root;
Where Claude Code looks for each file
lists those cases and where it saves the rule instead.
Before v2.1.211, Claude Code always saved the rule in the starting directory, so an approval granted in a worktree or subdirectory didn’t apply to the rest of the repository. Rules that earlier versions saved in a subdirectory or worktree still apply to sessions started there.
Sometimes a permission prompt offers only a one-time approval, with no “don’t ask again” option and no option to allow the action for the rest of the session. Claude Code offers those options only when the prompt can show you everything they would allow, so a rule you save from a prompt covers only what its option named.
When the directory you started Claude Code in is what makes the option’s label too long, Claude Code shortens it in the label, replacing your home directory with
~
and then the end of the path with
…
, and keeps the option. You still save the same rule. Claude Code leaves the options out in three cases:
Command or edit:
too large to show in full.
Commands or paths the rule would cover:
the label can’t fit them all.
Starting directory too long, not shortened:
it contains characters Claude Code can’t display safely, or even its start doesn’t fit.
Approve the action once, or add the rule yourself in
/permissions
.
​
Add a comment when you answer a permission prompt
You can attach a note to Claude when you approve or deny a single action. On most permission prompts, including Bash, PowerShell, file, and MCP tool prompts, move to
Yes
or
No
and press
Tab
to open a comment field on that option. WebFetch and browser prompts don’t offer the field. The options that allow the action for the rest of the session or save a rule don’t take one either.
With the field open, type the comment and then press one of these keys:
Enter
: submits your answer with the comment attached. If you leave the field empty, Claude Code submits the answer without a comment.
Tab
: closes the field without answering. Claude Code keeps the text you typed and still sends it if you answer with that option.
Shift+Tab
: on a file prompt, such as an Edit or Write prompt, closes the field the same as
Tab
. Before v2.1.235, pressing
Shift+Tab
inside the field instead selected the option that allows the action for the rest of the session, so Claude Code approved the action for the rest of the session and discarded the comment.
Claude Code delivers the comment differently depending on how you answered:
Yes
: Claude Code runs the action, then sends your comment to Claude after the result.
No
: Claude Code sends your comment to Claude as the reason for the denial, and Claude continues working. If you select
No
without a comment on a prompt from the main conversation, Claude Code stops the turn.
​
Manage permissions
You can view and manage Claude Code’s tool permissions with
/permissions
. The dialog lists all permission rules and the
settings.json
file each rule comes from. You can open the dialog while Claude is working: when you add or remove a rule, Claude Code applies the change starting with Claude’s next tool call in the same turn. Before v2.1.234, Claude Code queued the command until the turn finished.
Allow
rules let Claude Code use the specified tool without manual approval.
Ask
rules prompt for confirmation whenever Claude Code tries to use the specified tool.
Deny
rules prevent Claude Code from using the specified tool.
Rules are evaluated in order: deny, then ask, then allow. The first match in that order determines the outcome, and rule specificity doesn’t change the order.
A broad deny rule like
Bash(aws *)
blocks every matching call, including calls that also match a narrower allow rule like
Bash(aws s3 ls)
. An allow rule can’t carve an exception out of a deny rule. The same precedence applies between ask and allow: a matching ask rule prompts even when a more specific allow rule also matches the same call.
Deny rules behave differently depending on whether they name a tool or scope a pattern within one. A bare tool name like
Bash
removes the tool from Claude’s context entirely, so Claude never sees it. If you add such a rule mid-session, Claude can’t call the tool from its next tool call on;
Denying an entire tool
covers what happens to a definition Claude has already seen. A scoped rule like
Bash(rm *)
leaves the tool available and blocks matching calls when Claude attempts them.
Bare-name removal applies to every tool except
EndConversation
: a deny rule can’t remove it while any other tool remains, and an ask rule never prompts for it.
Permission rules are enforced by Claude Code, not by the model. Instructions in your prompt or
CLAUDE.md
shape what Claude tries to do, but they don’t change what Claude Code allows. To grant or revoke access, use
/permissions
, the rules described here, a
permission mode
, or a
PreToolUse hook
.
When
auto mode
is available to your session, the dialog also includes the
auto mode classifier rules
. Select the
Auto mode
tab to view them.
​
Permission modes
Claude Code supports several permission modes that control how it approves tool calls. See
Permission modes
for when to use each one. To change the mode sessions start in, set
defaultMode
in your
settings files
.
Which mode a session starts in
covers the built-in default for each plan and what the VS Code extension reads.
Mode
Description
default
Prompts for permission on first use of each tool. Labeled Manual in the CLI, the VS Code and JetBrains extensions, and the desktop app, and Claude Code accepts
manual
as an alias. The label and alias require Claude Code v2.1.200 or later. The desktop app’s label doesn’t depend on your CLI version
acceptEdits
Automatically accepts file edits and common filesystem commands such as
mkdir
,
touch
,
mv
, and
cp
for paths in the working directory or
additionalDirectories
plan
Claude reads files and runs read-only shell commands to explore but doesn’t edit your source files; with
auto mode
available, classifier-approved commands also run. Labeled Plan in the CLI and the VS Code extension
auto
Auto-approves tool calls with background safety checks that verify actions align with your request
dontAsk
Auto-denies every call that would otherwise prompt; file reads in your working directories and other actions that need no approval still run, as do tools pre-approved via
/permissions
or
permissions.allow
rules.
AskUserQuestion
, MCP tools marked
requiresUserInteraction
, and connector tools
your organization set to
ask
in sessions where that setting reaches Claude Code are denied even if you’ve allowed them
bypassPermissions
Skips permission prompts, except for the
actions no mode auto-approves
In
bypassPermissions
mode, Claude Code skips permission prompts, including for writes to
protected paths
such as
.git
and
.claude
. The
cross-session messaging safeguards
still apply. Only use this mode in isolated environments like containers or VMs where Claude Code can’t cause damage.
To prevent
bypassPermissions
or
auto
mode from being used, set
permissions.disableBypassPermissionsMode
or
permissions.disableAutoMode
to
"disable"
in any
settings file
. These are most useful in
managed settings
where they can’t be overridden.
​
Permission rule syntax
Permission rules follow the format
Tool
or
Tool(specifier)
. Parentheses inside the specifier are literal, so a command or path that contains them needs no escaping.
​
Match all uses of a tool
To match all uses of a tool, use only the tool name without parentheses:
Rule
Effect
Bash
Matches all Bash commands
WebFetch
Matches all web fetch requests
Read
Matches all file reads
Bash(*)
is equivalent to
Bash
and matches all Bash commands. As a deny rule, both forms remove the tool from Claude’s context.
​
Use specifiers for fine-grained control
Add a specifier in parentheses to match specific tool uses:
Rule
Effect
Bash(npm run build)
Matches the exact command
npm run build
Read(./.env)
Matches reading the
.env
file in the current directory
WebFetch(domain:example.com)
Matches fetch requests to example.com
​
Match by input parameter
Deny and ask rules can match a top-level input parameter on any built-in tool with
Tool(param:value)
.
To match a parameter on an MCP tool, pass a deny rule with
--disallowedTools
. When Claude Code loads a settings file, it skips any
mcp__
rule that has parentheses. Claude Code lists the skipped rule in the invalid-settings dialog when an interactive session starts, and in
claude doctor
output.
A parameter rule matches when Claude calls the tool with that parameter set to that exact value. An allow rule for one parameter value wouldn’t establish that the call is safe overall, so allow rules continue to use each tool’s own specifier syntax. This works for any scalar parameter the tool accepts:
Rule
Matches
Agent(model:opus)
Agent calls that request the Opus model tier
Agent(isolation:worktree)
Agent calls that request a git worktree
Bash(run_in_background:true)
Bash calls that run in the background
Parameter matching follows these rules:
The parameter name must be a direct field of the tool’s input, such as
model
on the Agent tool. Fields nested inside an object or array are not matchable
Each rule names one parameter. To gate on both
model
and
isolation
, write two rules,
Agent(model:opus)
and
Agent(isolation:worktree)
, rather than combining them in one rule
The value supports
*
as a wildcard that matches any sequence of characters, so
Agent(isolation:*)
matches any explicit isolation value. Without
*
the match is exact
A parameter the model omits is never matched, so
Agent(model:*)
doesn’t match a call that leaves
model
unset
The value is compared against the literal input Claude sends, before any normalization.
Agent(model:opus)
matches the alias
opus
but not a full model ID. Run with
--verbose
to see the exact parameter names and values in each tool call
Whitespace around the colon is ignored
You can’t match a tool’s primary content field this way:
command
for Bash and PowerShell,
file_path
for Read, Edit, and Write,
path
for Grep and Glob,
notebook_path
for NotebookEdit, and
url
for WebFetch. A rule like
Bash(command:rm *)
would be bypassable by a compound command, so Claude Code ignores it and emits a startup warning. Use
Bash(rm *)
,
Read(./path)
, or
WebFetch(domain:host)
instead.
​
Wildcard patterns
A
*
in a Bash rule matches any text, including spaces, so one rule covers a family of commands. A rule with no
*
matches one exact command.
Put the
*
after the subcommand. In
git log --oneline main
,
git
is the program and
log
is the subcommand, the word that determines what the program does. Claude Code matches everything before the first
*
as written, so those words are what limit the rule:
Bash(git log *)
allows only
git log
commands, and
Bash(git *)
allows every git command. Claude Code
warns at startup
about an allow rule with a
*
before the subcommand, such as
Bash(git * main)
.
Write the command you want Claude to run without asking, and replace the parts that vary with
*
. With this configuration, Claude Code runs npm scripts and git commits without asking and refuses commands that begin with
git push
. A push written another way, such as
git -C . push
, isn’t matched; see
what a Bash rule doesn’t match
.
{
"permissions"
: {
"allow"
: [
"Bash(npm run *)"
,
"Bash(git commit *)"
],
"deny"
: [
"Bash(git push *)"
]
}
}
A
*
can go anywhere in the rule: at the start, in the middle, or at the end. Each row shows a rule, commands it matches, and nearby commands it doesn’t match:
You write
Matches
Doesn’t match

Bash(* --help *)
npm --help x
npm --help
Three matching rules produce those rows:
The
*
stands in for whatever text is in its place.
In
Bash(git * main)
, it stands in for the subcommand, so Claude Code matches every git subcommand and every option before it. That includes
-c
, which makes git run a program you name. In
Bash(* --version)
, the
*
stands in for the program, so any program matches.
A
*
at the end, with a space before it, also matches the bare command.
Bash(ls *)
matches
ls
, and
Bash(git log *)
matches
git log
. That holds only when the trailing
*
is the rule’s only wildcard:
Bash(* --help *)
matches
npm --help x
but not
npm --help
.
The space before a trailing
*
is part of the rule.
Bash(ls *)
requires a space after
ls
, so
lsof
doesn’t match.
Bash(ls*)
has no space, so it matches
lsof
too.
The
:*
suffix is an equivalent way to write a trailing wildcard, so
Bash(ls:*)
matches the same commands as
Bash(ls *)
.
The permission dialog writes the space-separated form when you select “Yes, and don’t ask again” for a command prefix. The
:*
form is only recognized at the end of a pattern. In a pattern like
Bash(git:* push)
, the colon is treated as a literal character and won’t match git commands.
​
Tool name wildcards
Deny and ask rules also accept glob patterns in the tool-name position. The pattern must match the full tool name:
"*"
matches every tool, and
"mcp__*"
matches every MCP tool across all servers. A tool matched by a bare-name glob deny rule is removed from Claude’s context, the same as a bare tool name, including the
EndConversation
exception: a glob deny can’t remove it while any other tool remains, and a glob ask never prompts for it. This configuration denies every MCP tool:
{
"permissions"
: {
"deny"
: [
"mcp__*"
]
}
}
Allow rules accept tool-name globs only after a literal
mcp__<server>__
prefix. The server segment must be glob-free so the rule names a specific server you configured.
mcp__puppeteer__*
matches every tool from the
puppeteer
server, and
mcp__github__get_*
matches its
get_
tools. An unanchored allow glob such as
"*"
,
"B*"
, or
"mcp__*"
is skipped with a warning and doesn’t auto-approve anything.
A deny or ask rule whose tool name matches no known tool produces a startup warning to catch typos. Tool names containing
_
or
*
are exempt from the check.
The label shown for a tool in the transcript and permission dialog can differ from its canonical name. For example, the tool labeled
Stop Task
in the transcript has the canonical name
TaskStop
. Permission rules and
hook matchers
don’t match the label, so a rule written as
Stop Task
doesn’t match. For deny and ask rules, the startup warning above catches the mismatch. Use the canonical names listed in the
tools reference
.
​
Tool-specific permission rules
​
Bash
Bash rules match the whole command text, with
*
standing in for any text.
Wildcard patterns
shows which commands each rule shape matches and where to put the
*
. The rest of this section covers how Claude Code matches compound commands and wrappers, what a rule doesn’t match, read-only commands, and redirections.
​
Compound commands
Claude Code is aware of shell operators, so a rule like
Bash(safe-cmd *)
won’t give it permission to run the command
safe-cmd && other-cmd
. The recognized command separators are
&&
,
||
,
;
,
|
,
|&
,
&
, and newlines. A rule must match each subcommand independently.
Deny and ask rules apply when any subcommand matches them, including a command nested inside a subshell, a command substitution, or a control-flow body such as a
for
loop. An ask rule like
Bash(git clean *)
still prompts you for
cd /tmp && git clean -f
or
echo "$(git clean -f)"
, even in
auto mode
.
When
&&
or
||
has nothing after it, such as in
npm test &&
, Claude Code treats the command as unparseable and doesn’t split it into subcommands for allow-rule matching, so a rule such as
Bash(npm *)
doesn’t approve it.
When you approve a compound command with “Yes, and don’t ask again”, Claude Code saves a separate rule for each subcommand that requires approval, rather than a single rule for the full compound string. For example, approving
git status && npm test
saves a rule for
npm test
, so future
npm test
invocations are recognized regardless of what precedes the
&&
. Subcommands like
cd
into a subdirectory generate their own Read rule for that path. Up to 5 rules may be saved for a single compound command.
​
Wrappers
Before matching Bash rules, Claude Code strips a fixed set of wrappers, so a rule like
Bash(npm test *)
also matches
timeout 30 npm test
. The stripped wrappers are
timeout
,
time
,
nice
,
nohup
, and
stdbuf
, plus the shell builtins
command
and
builtin
, and zsh’s
noglob
. Each runs its argument as the actual command. Two related forms aren’t stripped: the query form
command -v
, which looks up a command rather than running one, and zsh’s
nocorrect
.
Claude Code also strips a leading assignment of certain known-safe environment variables, so
Bash(npm test *)
matches
NODE_ENV=test npm test
. An allow rule won’t match past an assignment of any other variable. A deny or ask rule matches past any leading assignment, so
Bash(rm *)
in deny still matches
FOO=bar rm -rf tmp/
.
Bare
xargs
is also stripped, so
Bash(grep *)
matches
xargs grep pattern
. Stripping applies only when
xargs
has no flags: an invocation like
xargs -n1 grep pattern
is matched as an
xargs
command, so rules written for the inner command do not cover it.
This wrapper list is built in and is not configurable. Development environment runners such as
direnv exec
,
devbox run
,
mise exec
,
npx
, and
docker exec
are not in the list. Because these tools execute their arguments as a command, a rule like
Bash(devbox run *)
matches whatever comes after
run
, including
devbox run rm -rf .
. To approve work inside an environment runner, write a specific rule that includes both the runner and the inner command, such as
Bash(devbox run npm test)
. Add one rule per inner command you want to allow.
Exec wrappers such as
watch
,
setsid
,
ionice
, and
flock
can’t be auto-approved by a prefix rule like
Bash(watch *)
, so in Manual mode they always prompt. The same applies to
find
with
-exec
or
-delete
: a
Bash(find *)
rule doesn’t cover these forms. To approve a specific invocation, write an exact-match rule for the full command string.
​
What a Bash rule doesn’t match
A Bash rule matches the command text Claude writes, after Claude Code splits
compound commands
and strips
wrappers
. It doesn’t match the same program invoked in a different form, so a deny or ask rule covers the invocation Claude usually produces and isn’t a security boundary around the program. These rules in
deny
or
ask
stop the first form and not the others:
Rule
Stops
Doesn’t stop
Bash(curl *)
curl https://example.com
/usr/bin/curl https://example.com
,
sh -c 'curl https://example.com'
Bash(rm *)
rm -rf build/
/bin/rm -rf build/
,
bash -c 'rm -rf build/'
Bash(git push *)
git push origin main
git -C . push origin main
,
git -c push.default=current push origin main
,
git 'push' origin main
Your other rules and the permission mode decide the commands in the last column.
For filesystem and network enforcement that doesn’t depend on the command text, use
sandboxing
. To inspect the full command text with your own logic before it runs, use a
PreToolUse hook
.
​
Read-only commands
Claude Code recognizes a built-in set of Bash commands as read-only and runs them without a permission prompt in every mode, except for a path that
permissions.blockReadsOutsideWorkingDirectories
fences. The set includes
ls
,
cat
,
echo
,
pwd
,
head
,
tail
,
grep
,
find
,
wc
,
which
,
diff
,
stat
,
du
,
cd
, and read-only forms of
git
. The set is not configurable; to require a prompt for one of these commands, add an
ask
or
deny
rule for it.
A redirect such as
ls > out.txt
adds a check on the target. See
Redirections
.
Unquoted glob patterns are permitted for commands whose every flag is read-only, so
ls *.ts
and
wc -l src/*.py
run without a prompt.
In Manual mode, commands from this set still prompt in these cases:
Unquoted globs for commands with write-capable flags
: commands with write-capable or exec-capable flags, such as
find
,
sort
,
sed
, and
git
, prompt when an unquoted glob is present, because the glob could expand to a flag like
-delete
.
docker
pointed at another daemon
: read-only forms of
docker
prompt when the command carries a flag that selects a different daemon, such as
-H
,
--context
, or Podman’s
--url
and
--connection
.
file
with path-opening flags
:
file
prompts when it passes
-m
/
--magic-file
or
-f
/
--files-from
, because those flags make
file
open the paths named in the flag’s value.
Network paths on Windows
: a command whose arguments include a network (UNC) path, such as
\\server\share\file
, prompts because accessing a network path can send your Windows credentials to the host it names. The same check applies to
PowerShell tool
commands.
Commands the analysis can’t parse
: when Claude Code can’t fully parse a command, it asks for approval instead of treating the command as read-only. Commands longer than 10,000 characters always prompt because they exceed what the analysis parses.
A
cd
into a path inside your working directory or an
additional directory
is also read-only, and a compound command like
cd packages/api && ls
runs without a prompt when each part qualifies on its own. These combinations prompt even when each part is read-only:
cd
with
git
: prompts when the
cd
changes into a different directory, since running
git
in a new directory can execute that directory’s hooks. A
cd
whose target resolves to the current working directory is a no-op and doesn’t trigger the prompt.
cd
with a redirect
: prompts when Claude Code can’t determine which directory the redirect target resolves against after the
cd
runs. A command whose only redirect target is
/dev/null
, such as
cd app; grep -r pattern . 2>/dev/null
, doesn’t prompt, because
/dev/null
doesn’t depend on the working directory.
Bash permission patterns that try to constrain command arguments are fragile. For example,
Bash(curl http://github.com/ *)
intends to restrict curl to GitHub URLs, but won’t match variations like:
Options before URL:
curl -X GET http://github.com/...
Different protocol:
curl https://github.com/...
Redirects:
curl -L http://short.example.com/xyz
, which redirects to GitHub
Variables:
URL=http://github.com && curl $URL
For more reliable URL filtering, consider:
Restrict Bash network tools
: use deny rules to stop
curl
,
wget
, and similar commands, then use the WebFetch tool with
WebFetch(domain:github.com)
permission for allowed domains. A deny rule doesn’t match the same program by path or inside
sh -c
, so pair it with the
sandbox network allowlist
when the restriction must hold; see
what a Bash rule doesn’t match
Use PreToolUse hooks
: implement a hook that validates URLs in Bash commands and blocks disallowed domains
Add CLAUDE.md guidance
: describe your allowed curl patterns in
CLAUDE.md
. This shapes what Claude tries but doesn’t enforce a boundary, so pair it with one of the options above
Note that using WebFetch alone doesn’t prevent network access. If Bash is allowed, Claude can still use
curl
,
wget
, or other tools to reach any URL.
​
Redirections
When a command redirects output or input, Claude Code checks the redirect target against your file rules as if Claude wrote or read that file directly:
Output redirects
: for
> file
,
>> file
, or
2> file
, the check covers your
Edit
allow and deny rules,
protected paths
, and the
working directories
. A rule such as
Bash(git commit *)
allows the command, not the target. A target that starts with
~
or contains a glob character needs your approval.
Input redirects
: for
< file
, the check covers your
Read
allow and deny rules and the working directories. A target outside the working directories needs your approval unless an allow rule covers it. A target that contains a glob pattern, or a relative path that follows a
cd
in the same command, needs your approval even when an allow rule covers it. Claude Code checks input targets in v2.1.257 and later.
Targets with no file behind them aren’t checked:
/dev/null
, file-descriptor forms such as
2>&1
and
<&3
, and here-docs and here-strings.
Claude Code also checks the files a
tee
command writes, including in a pipeline such as
make | tee build.log
. The check covers your
Edit
allow and deny rules,
protected paths
, and the
working directories
. An allow rule such as
Bash(tee *)
doesn’t cover a destination outside the working directories. Claude Code checks
tee
targets in v2.1.269 and later.
​
PowerShell
PowerShell permission rules use the same shape as Bash rules. Wildcards with
*
match at any position, the
:*
suffix is equivalent to a trailing
*
, and a bare
PowerShell
or
PowerShell(*)
matches every command. This configuration allows
Get-ChildItem
and
git commit
commands while blocking
Remove-Item
:
{
"permissions"
: {
"allow"
: [
"PowerShell(Get-ChildItem *)"
,
"PowerShell(git commit *)"
],
"deny"
: [
"PowerShell(Remove-Item *)"
]
}
}
Common aliases are canonicalized before matching. A rule written for the cmdlet name also matches its aliases, so
PowerShell(Get-ChildItem *)
matches
gci
,
ls
, and
dir
as well. Matching is case-insensitive.
Claude Code parses the PowerShell AST and checks each command in a compound command independently. Pipeline operators
|
, statement separators
;
, and on PowerShell 7+ the chain operators
&&
and
||
split a compound command into subcommands. A rule must match every subcommand for the compound command to be allowed.
​
Read and Edit
To block Claude’s file tools from reading a file or directory, add a
Read
deny rule for its path, such as
Read(./.env)
or
Read(./secrets/**)
;
Exclude sensitive files
has a paste-ready example.
Edit
rules apply to all built-in tools that edit files. Claude makes a best-effort attempt to apply
Read
rules to all built-in tools that read files like Grep and Glob, to
@file
mentions in your prompts, and to the selection and open-file context that a connected
IDE
shares with Claude.
A
Read
deny rule also blocks the
Edit and Write tools
on the same path, including creating a new file there. NotebookEdit isn’t covered, so add an
Edit
deny rule for paths no tool may change. The check requires Claude Code v2.1.208 or later on edits, and v2.1.228 or later on writes.
Claude Code checks file permissions against
Edit(path)
and
Read(path)
rules only. If you write a path rule for
Write
,
NotebookEdit
,
Glob
, or the legacy
MultiEdit
tool instead, Claude Code accepts the rule but never consults it, and
warns at startup
, except for a
Glob
rule passed in
--allowedTools
. Use
Edit(docs/**)
in place of
Write(docs/**)
,
NotebookEdit(docs/**)
, or
MultiEdit(docs/**)
, and
Read(docs/**)
in place of
Glob(docs/**)
. Claude Code doesn’t warn about a tool-name rule with no path, such as a deny rule for
Write
; it matches that rule at the tool level everywhere. Requires Claude Code v2.1.210 or later.
Read and Edit deny rules apply to Claude’s built-in file tools, to file commands Claude Code recognizes in Bash, such as
cat
,
head
,
tail
,
sed
, and
tee
, and to the targets of Bash
redirections
such as
> file
and
< file
. They don’t apply to a command that reads files without naming them, such as
grep -r pattern .
run from the directory that holds the file, or to arbitrary subprocesses that read or write files indirectly, like a Python or Node script that opens files itself. For OS-level enforcement that blocks all processes from accessing a path,
enable the sandbox
.
Read and Edit rules both use
gitignore
pattern syntax with four distinct pattern types; for single-segment directory patterns, the matching depth also depends on the rule type, described later in this section:
Pattern
Meaning
Example
Matches
//path
Absolute path from filesystem root
Read(//Users/alice/secrets/**)
/Users/alice/secrets/**
~/path
Path from home directory
Read(~/Documents/*.pdf)
/Users/alice/Documents/*.pdf
/path
Path relative to the settings source
Edit(/src/**/*.ts)
<primary working directory>/src/**/*.ts
in project settings
path
or
./path
Path relative to current directory
Read(*.env)
<cwd>/*.env
A pattern like
/Users/alice/file
isn’t an absolute path. The single leading slash anchors at the settings source, not the filesystem root. Use
//Users/alice/file
for absolute paths.
A
/path
pattern anchors at a directory associated with the settings source that defines it, so the same rule matches different locations depending on where you put it:
Rule defined in
/path
resolves to
Project settings at
.claude/settings.json
<primary working directory>/path
Local settings at
.claude/settings.local.json
<primary working directory>/path
User settings at
~/.claude/settings.json
~/.claude/path
A file passed with
--settings <file>
<directory of file>/path
CLI flags or session rules
<primary working directory>/path
A rule you add through
/permissions
follows the row for the settings file you save it to.
Local settings rules anchor at the session’s
primary working directory
, not at the repository root where Claude Code
stores the file
in v2.1.211 and later. In a session started at the repository root, the two directories are the same; in a
worktree
session, a shared rule such as
Edit(/src/**)
matches that worktree’s own
src/
directory.
A deny rule such as
Read(/secrets/**)
in user settings blocks
~/.claude/secrets/**
, not a
secrets
directory in your project. To write a rule in user settings that applies inside every project, use a
//
absolute path or a
~/
home-relative path instead.
On Windows, paths are normalized to POSIX form before matching.
C:\Users\alice
becomes
/c/Users/alice
, so use
//c/**/.env
to match
.env
files anywhere on that drive. To match across all drives, use
//**/.env
.
Examples:
Edit(/docs/**)
: edits in
<primary working directory>/docs/
, not
/docs/
or
<primary working directory>/.claude/docs/
Read(~/.zshrc)
: reads your home directory’s
.zshrc
Edit(//tmp/scratch.txt)
: edits the absolute path
/tmp/scratch.txt
Read(src/**)
: as an allow rule, reads from
<current-directory>/src/
only; as a deny or ask rule, matches a
src
directory at any depth under the current directory
A rule only matches files under its anchor; within that bound, matching depth depends on the pattern shape and, for single-segment directory patterns, the rule type, described below. Bare filenames follow gitignore semantics and match at any depth, so
Read(.env)
and
Read(**/.env)
are equivalent:
Deny rule
Blocks
Does not block
Read(.env)
or
Read(**/.env)
any
.env
at or under the current directory
.env
in a parent directory or another project
Read(//**/.env)
any
.env
anywhere on the filesystem
nothing; the rule is anchored at the filesystem root
A relative pattern with a single directory segment, such as
src/**
, matches at different depths depending on the rule type:
Allow rules
:
Edit(src/**)
matches only
<cwd>/src
and the files under it. To allow a directory name at any depth, write
Edit(**/src/**)
.
Deny and ask rules
:
Read(secrets/**)
matches a directory named
secrets
at any depth under the current directory, so the rule also applies to nested copies.
Every other pattern shape matches at the same depth in every rule type:
Edit(/src/**)
and
Edit(src/components/**)
match only at their anchored location, while
Edit(**/src/**)
matches at any depth.
The following example shows each pattern shape against a project with a top-level
src/
directory and a nested copy under
vendor/
:
<current-directory>/
├── src/
│   └── app.ts
└── vendor/
└── pkg/
└── src/
└── lib.js
Rule
Matches
src/app.ts
Matches
vendor/pkg/src/lib.js
Edit(src/**)
as an allow rule
Yes
No
Edit(src/**)
as a deny or ask rule
Yes
Yes
Edit(/src/**)
in any rule type
Yes
No
Edit(**/src/**)
in any rule type
Yes
Yes
In gitignore patterns,
*
matches within a single path segment and can appear at any position in the pattern, while
**
matches across directories.
When you approve a file path with “Yes, and don’t ask again”, Claude Code escapes gitignore pattern characters in that path, such as
[
,
]
, and
*
, so the generated rule matches only the literal path you approved. Rules you write yourself aren’t escaped. Before v2.1.202, Claude Code saved the path unescaped, so a generated rule for a directory named
[2024-06] Reports
could fail to match its own path or match unintended sibling directories.
You don’t need to escape parentheses in a path, so
Edit(./Finance (2024)/**)
matches the
Finance (2024)
folder as spelled.
A deny or ask rule whose path isn’t usable as a gitignore pattern still guards that exact path. An allow rule with an unusable pattern doesn’t approve anything.
A deny or ask pattern that starts with
!
is a gitignore negation. It carves the paths it matches out of the
path
or
./path
rules listed before it. In one settings file’s
deny
list,
Read(*.env)
followed by
Read(!sample.env)
blocks every file whose name ends in
.env
at any depth, except files named
sample.env
. A
!
rule listed first carves nothing out.
The carve-out reaches only rules from the same source. A
Read(!.env)
in project settings or in
--disallowedTools
doesn’t cancel a
Read(./.env)
deny from managed settings or any other settings file.
Two limits narrow what a
!
pattern can carve out:
Claude Code reads a
!
pattern relative to the current directory even when
/
,
~/
, or
//
follows the
!
, so the pattern can’t reach a rule anchored with one of those prefixes.
Read(!~/notes/public/**)
carves nothing out of
Read(~/notes/**)
.
A carve-out can’t reopen a file inside a directory that a rule blocks as a whole. With
Read(secrets/**)
and
Read(!secrets/public/**)
, Claude Code still blocks
secrets/public
along with the rest of
secrets
.
When Claude accesses a symlink, permission rules check two paths: the symlink itself and the file it resolves to. Allow and deny rules treat that pair differently: allow rules fall back to prompting you, while deny rules block outright.
Allow rules
: apply only when both the symlink path and its target match. A symlink inside an allowed directory that points outside it still prompts you.
Deny rules
: apply when either the symlink path or its target matches. A symlink that points to a denied file is itself denied. For example, with
Read(./project/**)
allowed and
Read(~/.ssh/**)
denied, a symlink at
./project/key
pointing to
~/.ssh/id_rsa
is blocked: the target fails the allow rule and matches the deny rule.
On macOS and Linux, a deny or ask rule written through a symlinked directory with a
//
,
~/
, or
/
pattern also applies at the directory’s real location. For example, on macOS, where
/etc
resolves to
/private/etc
,
Read(//etc/**)
blocks
/private/etc/hosts
too. Before v2.1.268, a deny or ask rule written through a symlinked directory didn’t apply to a path given by its real location.
When a tool opens an approved file, Claude Code
confirms the path still resolves to the location the permission check approved
.
Grep and Glob search the directory the
path
argument resolves to. Claude Code applies
Read
deny rules to that directory.
​
WebFetch
WebFetch rules use a
domain:
prefix and match against the hostname of the requested URL. Matching is case-insensitive, supports
*
wildcards, and strips a trailing
.
from both the rule and the hostname so
example.com.
and
example.com
are treated the same.
WebFetch(domain:example.com)
matches requests to
example.com
WebFetch(domain:*.example.com)
matches any subdomain at any depth, such as
api.example.com
or
a.b.example.com
, but not
example.com
itself
WebFetch(domain:*)
matches every domain. It isn’t the same as a bare
WebFetch
rule; see
Allow or deny every fetch
In any position other than a leading
*.
or a bare
*
, the wildcard matches only the text between two dots.
WebFetch(domain:example.*)
matches
example.org
, where
*
becomes
org
, but not
example.evil.com
, where
*
would have to become
evil.com
and cross a dot. This keeps a trailing wildcard from matching domains an attacker could register.
Wildcards in
WebFetch
rules require Claude Code v2.1.172 or later to match fetches.
​
Allow or deny every fetch
A bare
WebFetch
rule is the tool name with no
domain:
part, such as
"deny": ["WebFetch"]
. Both it and
WebFetch(domain:*)
cover every URL, but Claude Code applies them differently, and only the
domain:
form also adds its domain to the sandbox’s
allowed or denied domain list
. That section lists the wildcard forms the sandbox honors and the version that added bare
*
.
Each row shows what a rule does in the
allow
list and in the
deny
list:
Rule
In
allow
In
deny
WebFetch
Claude fetches without prompting you. Doesn’t change which hosts sandboxed commands can reach.
Claude Code removes the
WebFetch
tool, so Claude can’t fetch at all. Doesn’t change which hosts sandboxed commands can reach.
WebFetch(domain:*)
Claude fetches without prompting you, and sandboxed commands can reach any host.
Claude Code keeps the tool and refuses each fetch, and sandboxed commands can’t reach any host.
The two forms also differ on reads of
artifacts
, the pages the Artifact tool publishes on claude.ai. A bare
WebFetch
deny or ask rule doesn’t apply to those reads. A
domain:
rule covering
claude.ai
or the
*.claudeusercontent.com
content host, such as
WebFetch(domain:claude.ai)
or
WebFetch(domain:*)
, denies each read or prompts before it. An
Artifact
rule
does the same.
When a rule blocks a read, the denial names the rule. Before v2.1.268, a bare
WebFetch
deny rule blocked every artifact read, and a bare ask rule prompted before each one.
To let Claude fetch freely while keeping the sandbox allowlist as it is, use the bare form. This
settings.json
does that:
{
"permissions"
: {
"allow"
: [
"WebFetch"
]
}
}
When you ask Claude to fetch a page, it fetches without a prompt. When you ask it to run a
sandboxed
curl
against a host outside the sandbox allowlist, Claude Code still prompts you for that host, because the bare rule didn’t add the host to the allowlist.
In
auto mode
, Claude instead names the host in the command’s
per-command allowed domains
for the classifier to review.
​
MCP
MCP rules use the server name as configured in Claude Code, optionally followed by the name of a tool from that server.
mcp__puppeteer
matches any tool provided by the
puppeteer
server
mcp__puppeteer__*
uses wildcard syntax and also matches all tools from the
puppeteer
server
mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate
matches the
puppeteer_navigate
tool provided by the
puppeteer
server
If your organization has set a
claude.ai connector
tool to
ask
and that setting reaches Claude Code in your session, allow rules for that tool don’t take effect: Claude Code prompts on every call, even in
auto
and
bypassPermissions
modes. In
dontAsk
mode, which never prompts, Claude Code denies the call instead. Tools from connectors Claude Code fetches itself appear as
mcp__claude_ai_<server>__<tool>
.
In a
Cowork
session in the Claude Desktop app, Claude runs shell commands through Cowork’s
mcp__workspace__bash
tool rather than the built-in
Bash
tool, and Cowork likewise provides
mcp__workspace__web_fetch
for web fetches. Claude Code also applies deny rules that name the whole
Bash
or
WebFetch
tool to these Cowork tools, so a managed
Bash
deny rule stops Claude from running shell commands in Cowork. When Claude Code blocks such a call, the message names the Cowork tool:
Permission to use mcp__workspace__bash has been denied.
Allow rules don’t carry over: Claude Code never applies a
Bash
allow rule to
mcp__workspace__bash
.
​
Agent (subagents)
Use
Agent(AgentName)
rules to control which
subagents
Claude can use:
Agent(Explore)
matches the Explore subagent
Agent(Plan)
matches the Plan subagent
Agent(my-custom-agent)
matches a custom subagent named
my-custom-agent
Add these rules to the
deny
array in your settings or use the
--disallowedTools
CLI flag to disable specific agents. To disable the Explore agent:
{
"permissions"
: {
"deny"
: [
"Agent(Explore)"
]
}
}
​
Cd
Cd
rules control which directories the
/cd
command
can move the session to.
Cd
is not a model-invocable tool: Claude can’t call it, and the rules apply only when you run
/cd
yourself.
A bare
Cd
deny rule disables
/cd
entirely. A
Cd(<path-pattern>)
deny rule blocks matching targets. Deny rules check every spelling of the target, including each symlink hop it resolves through, so a rule written for one path also blocks targets that resolve to it.
Adding any
Cd
allow rule switches
/cd
to allowlist mode: the resolved target directory must match one of your allow rules, or
/cd
refuses. With no
Cd
rules configured,
/cd
keeps its default behavior and prompts you to trust an unfamiliar directory.
Path patterns share the
//
,
~/
, and
/
anchors from
Read and Edit rules
, but matching is anchored to the whole directory path rather than gitignore-style.
*
matches exactly one path segment and
**
matches across segments. A trailing
/**
also matches its named root.
Rule
Matches
Does not match
Cd(~/code/*)
~/code/app
~/code/app/src
,
~/code
Cd(~/code/**)
~/code
and any directory under it
directories outside
~/code
Cd(**/node_modules)
any
node_modules
directory at any depth under the current directory
node_modules/pkg
​
Extend permissions with hooks
Claude Code hooks
let you register custom shell commands that evaluate permissions at runtime. When Claude Code makes a tool call, PreToolUse hooks run before the permission prompt, for every tool except
EndConversation
. The hook output can deny the tool call, force a prompt, or skip the prompt to let the call proceed.
Hook decisions don’t bypass permission rules. Claude Code evaluates deny and ask rules regardless of what a PreToolUse hook returns: a matching deny rule blocks the call, and a matching ask rule still prompts even when the hook returned
"allow"
or
"ask"
. This preserves the deny-first precedence described in
Manage permissions
, including deny rules set in managed settings.
MCP tools marked
requiresUserInteraction
also still prompt when a hook returns
"allow"
, as do connector tools
your organization set to
ask
in sessions where that setting reaches Claude Code.
A blocking hook also takes precedence over allow rules. A hook that exits with code 2 stops the tool call before permission rules are evaluated, so the block applies even when an allow rule would otherwise let the call proceed. To run all Bash commands without prompts except for a few you want blocked, add
"Bash"
to your allow list and register a PreToolUse hook that rejects those specific commands. See
Block edits to protected files
for a hook script you can adapt.
​
Working directories
By default, Claude has access to files in the directory where you launched it. That directory is the session’s primary working directory until you
move the session with
/cd
. You can extend this access:
During startup
: use
--add-dir <path>
CLI argument
During session
: use
/add-dir
command
Persistent configuration
: add to
additionalDirectories
in
settings files
Files in additional directories follow the same permission rules as the original working directory: they become readable without prompts, and file editing permissions follow the current permission mode.
You can’t add most
network paths
, such as the UNC share
\\server\share
, as working directories, because looking one up can contact the host it names. On Windows, map the share to a drive letter instead and pass the drive with
--add-dir
at launch.
Set
permissions.blockReadsOutsideWorkingDirectories
to make the file tools refuse the paths it fences in every permission mode. In auto mode, Claude Code offers to turn it on the first time Claude
reads outside the working directories
.
In background sessions on macOS, the session host requests access to protected folders such as
~/Desktop
,
~/Documents
, and
~/Downloads
separately from your terminal when Claude needs to read or write files there; if reads there fail with
Operation not permitted
, see
how to grant folder access to background sessions
.
​
Move the session to another directory
To move the session to a different primary working directory, rather than
adding a directory
alongside the current one, run
/cd <path>
. Claude Code keeps the conversation, loads the new directory’s
CLAUDE.md
, and prompts you to
trust the workspace
if you haven’t worked in it before. Afterward, Claude Code
finds the moved session
when you run
--resume
from the new directory.
As soon as you move, Claude Code applies the new directory’s project configuration:
Its project settings, including their permission rules and
hooks
Its
.mcp.json
servers
, subject to the same
server approval
as at startup, and the
local-scope
MCP servers you registered in it
The
plugins
its settings enable, its
skills
, and its
subagents
Its
env
values, applied on top of the environment variables from the previous directory’s settings, which stay in effect
Claude Code also disconnects the previous directory’s project and
local-scope
MCP servers, and the servers of
plugins
that are no longer enabled after the move. It takes
additional directories
from the new directory’s settings instead of the previous one’s, and keeps the directories you added with
--add-dir
or
/add-dir
. Hooks the move activates still receive
${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}
set to the project root where the session started.
When the new directory isn’t trusted yet, Claude Code lists in the trust prompt the allow rules, additional directories, hooks, and helper commands the directory’s settings would activate, so you can review them before you accept. If you decline, the session stays where it is. Before v2.1.246,
/cd
didn’t apply the new directory’s settings, hooks, MCP servers, or skills until you resumed the session, and its trust prompt didn’t list what the directory’s settings would activate.
Restrict or disable
/cd
targets with
Cd
permission rules
.
​
Additional directories grant file access, not configuration
Adding a directory extends where Claude can read and edit files. It doesn’t make that directory a full configuration root: most
.claude/
configuration is not discovered from additional directories, though a few types are loaded as exceptions.
These exceptions apply only to directories added with the
--add-dir
flag or the
/add-dir
command, including directories the Agent SDK adds through the flag. Directories listed in
permissions.additionalDirectories
in a settings file grant file access only and don’t load any of the configuration below.
The Agent SDK’s
additionalDirectories
option in TypeScript and
add_dirs
option in Python receive the exceptions too, even though the TypeScript option shares its name with the settings key. The SDK passes each entry to Claude Code as
--add-dir
, so those directories behave like flag-added directories. Skills, commands, and subagents from any flag-added directory load through the
project
setting source
, so they don’t load when you exclude that source with
--setting-sources
on the CLI or
settingSources
in the SDK, and
bare mode
skips the commands and subagents among them.
The following configuration types are loaded from
--add-dir
directories:

Agent teams are experimental and disabled by default. Enable them by setting
CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1
in your
settings.json
or environment. Without that variable, no team is set up at session start, no team directories are written, and Claude does not spawn or propose teammates. Agent teams have
known limitations
around session resumption, task coordination, and shutdown behavior.
Agent teams let you coordinate multiple Claude Code instances working together. One session acts as the team lead, coordinating work, assigning tasks, and synthesizing results. Teammates work independently, each in its own context window, and communicate directly with each other. You can also talk to any teammate directly without going through the lead.
Before you set up a team, check whether a lighter option does the job.
Subagents
work within a single session, and with
cross-session messaging
Claude can pass findings between the sessions you run yourself.
This page describes agent teams as of v2.1.178. With
CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS
set, spawning a teammate no longer needs a setup step, and cleanup happens automatically when the session exits. Before v2.1.178, you asked Claude to create and name a team first, and Claude used the
TeamCreate
and
TeamDelete
tools to set it up and remove it. Both tools no longer exist. The
team_name
input on the Agent tool is accepted but ignored, and the
team_name
field in
TaskCreated
,
TaskCompleted
, and
TeammateIdle
hook payloads
carries the session-derived name and is deprecated.
​
When to use agent teams
Agent teams are most effective for tasks where parallel exploration adds real value. See
use case examples
for full scenarios. The strongest use cases are:
Research and review
: multiple teammates can investigate different aspects of a problem simultaneously, then share and challenge each other’s findings
New modules or features
: teammates can each own a separate piece without stepping on each other
Debugging with competing hypotheses
: teammates test different theories in parallel and converge on the answer faster
Cross-layer coordination
: changes that span frontend, backend, and tests, each owned by a different teammate
Agent teams add coordination overhead and use significantly more tokens than a single session. They work best when teammates can operate independently. For sequential tasks, same-file edits, or work with many dependencies, a single session or
subagents
are more effective.
​
Compare with subagents
Both agent teams and
subagents
let you parallelize work, but they operate differently. For separate sessions that pass messages to each other without a team, see
cross-session messaging
.
Subagents report results back to the main agent. In agent teams, teammates share a task list, claim work, and communicate directly with each other.
Subagents
Agent teams
Context
Own context window; results return to the caller
Own context window; fully independent
Communication
Return a result to the caller. Subagents that Claude named when it spawned them can also
message each other
Teammates message each other directly
Coordination
Main agent manages all work
Self-coordination through messages, plus a shared task list for
agents that have the Task tools
Best for
Focused tasks where only the result matters
Complex work requiring discussion and collaboration
Token cost
Lower: results summarized back to main context
Higher: each teammate is a separate Claude instance
Use subagents when you need quick, focused workers that report back. Use agent teams when teammates need to share findings, challenge each other, and coordinate on their own.
​
Enable agent teams
Agent teams are disabled by default. Enable them by setting the
CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS
environment variable to
1
, either in your shell environment or through
settings.json
:
settings.json
{
"env"
: {
"CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS"
:
"1"
}
}
Enabling agent teams also changes ordinary delegation. Claude may
name a subagent
on its own, and while agent teams are enabled, a subagent that Claude names launches as a teammate, so teams can form even when you didn’t ask for one. For more, see
How Claude starts agent teams
; to turn the behavior off, see
Claude spawns teammates instead of subagents
.
Spawning teammates also requires an interactive session. In
non-interactive mode
with the
-p
flag, including Agent SDK sessions, Claude doesn’t spawn teammates, and a subagent that Claude names runs as an ordinary
subagent
even with agent teams enabled.
​
Start your first agent team
After enabling agent teams, describe the task and the teammates you want in natural language. Claude spawns them and coordinates work based on your prompt.
This example works well because the three roles are independent and can explore the problem without waiting on each other:
I'm designing a CLI tool that helps developers track TODO comments across
their codebase. Spawn three teammates to explore this from different angles:
one on UX, one on technical architecture, one playing devil's advocate.
From there, Claude populates a
shared task list
in a
session that has the Task tools
, spawns teammates for each perspective, has them explore the problem, and synthesizes findings when finished.
Claude may sometimes use
subagents
instead of creating a team. Subagents appear in the same agent panel as teammates, so the panel alone doesn’t confirm a team formed. If Claude spawned subagents instead, ask again and explicitly request an agent team.
The lead’s terminal lists teammates in the agent panel below the prompt input. From the panel:
Up and down arrows
: select a teammate
Enter
: open the selected teammate’s transcript and message it directly
Escape
: clear the selection. While you’re viewing a teammate’s transcript, Escape interrupts that teammate’s current turn
As of v2.1.199, an idle teammate’s row stays in the panel while any teammate or subagent is still working, so you can select it to review its transcript or send it more work. Once every agent in the panel is idle, idle rows hide after 30 seconds and reappear on the teammate’s next turn; the teammate stays running and addressable while hidden. In v2.1.181 through v2.1.198, an idle row hid 30 seconds after its own turn ended, even while other teammates were still working; idle rows are not hidden on versions before v2.1.181.
When more than three teammates are idle at once, the rows beyond the first three collapse into a single row that counts the collapsed teammates, such as
2 idle agents
when five are idle. Select it and press Enter to expand the collapsed rows, or press Esc to collapse them again. Working teammates, failed teammates, and the teammate you’re viewing always keep their own rows.
If you want each teammate in its own split pane, see
Choose a display mode
.
​
Control your agent team
Tell the lead what you want in natural language. It handles team coordination, task assignment, and delegation based on your instructions.
​
Choose a display mode
Agent teams support two display modes:
In-process
: all teammates run inside your main terminal. Use the up and down arrow keys in the agent panel to select a teammate, then press Enter to view it and type to message it directly. Works in any terminal, no extra setup required.
Split panes
: each teammate gets its own pane. You can see everyone’s output at once and click into a pane to interact directly. Requires tmux, or iTerm2.
tmux
has known limitations on certain operating systems and traditionally works best on macOS. Using
tmux -CC
in iTerm2 is the suggested entrypoint into
tmux
.
The default is
"in-process"
. Set
"auto"
to enable split panes when you’re already running inside a tmux session, or when your terminal is iTerm2 with the
it2
CLI installed, falling back to in-process otherwise. The
"tmux"
setting enables split-pane mode and auto-detects whether to use tmux or iTerm2 based on your terminal.
As of v2.1.186, set
"iterm2"
to use iTerm2 native split panes explicitly. This mode requires the
it2
CLI
and shows an error with the install command if
it2
is missing. The setup prompt that offers to install
it2
or switch to tmux appears under
"auto"
or
"tmux"
when your terminal is iTerm2 and tmux is available as a fallback.
To override the default, set
teammateMode
in
~/.claude/settings.json
:
{
"teammateMode"
:
"auto"
}
To set the mode for a single session, pass it as a flag:
claude
--teammate-mode
auto
The
--teammate-mode
flag is experimental and doesn’t appear in
claude --help
.
Split-pane mode requires either
tmux
or iTerm2 with the
it2
CLI
. To install manually:
tmux
: install through your system’s package manager. See the
tmux wiki
for platform-specific instructions.
iTerm2
: install the
it2
CLI
, then enable the Python API in
iTerm2 → Settings → General → Magic → Enable Python API
.
​
Specify teammates and models
Claude decides the number of teammates to spawn based on your task, or you can specify exactly what you want:
Spawn 4 teammates to refactor these modules in parallel. Use Sonnet for
each teammate.
Claude Code picks each teammate’s model from the first of these that applies:
The model your spawn prompt names for that teammate.
For a teammate spawned from a
subagent definition
, the definition’s
model
, where
inherit
selects the lead’s model.
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL
, when it’s set to anything other than
inherit
.
The lead’s current model.
If you set
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE=1
, the first two sources don’t apply. Claude Code picks every teammate’s model from
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL
when it’s set to anything other than
inherit
, and from the lead’s current model otherwise. Requires Claude Code v2.1.257 or later.
Before v2.1.251,
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL
came first in this order.
teammateDefaultModel
was removed in v2.1.234; Claude Code ignores a leftover value. Name the model in your prompt instead.
Claude Code checks the model it selects for a teammate against your organization’s
availableModels
allowlist. When the allowlist blocks a value, Claude Code substitutes another model:
Family alias such as
opus
: On the Anthropic API and Claude Platform on AWS, Claude Code runs the teammate on the newest version of that family the allowlist permits. On providers with provider-specific model IDs, where the
substitution doesn’t operate
, a blocked alias falls back like any other blocked value per the next bullet
Any other blocked value, including a family alias on providers where the substitution doesn’t operate, or one whose family has no permitted version
: Claude Code runs the teammate on the lead’s model instead. If you set
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL
, Claude Code tries that model first, under these same rules
Teammates inherit the lead’s
effort level
. In split-pane mode this applies from v2.1.186; earlier versions did not pass the lead’s session effort to split-pane teammates.
​
Have teammates plan before implementing
For complex or risky tasks, you can have teammates plan before implementing. A teammate that Claude spawns while the lead is in
plan mode
works in read-only plan mode until its plan is ready. Switch the lead into plan mode first, then ask for the teammate:
Spawn an architect teammate to refactor the authentication module.
When a teammate finishes planning, it sends a plan approval request to the lead. Claude Code approves the plan in the lead’s session as soon as the request arrives, without the lead reviewing it. The teammate’s edits and commands still go through the permission prompts described in
Permissions
. Once approved, the teammate exits plan mode and begins implementation.
​
Talk to teammates directly
Each teammate is a full, independent Claude Code session. You can message any teammate directly to give additional instructions, ask follow-up questions, or redirect their approach.
In-process mode
: use the up and down arrow keys in the agent panel to select a teammate, then press Enter to view its session and type to send it a message. Press
x
on a selected teammate to stop it. Press Ctrl+T to toggle the task list.
Split-pane mode
: click into a teammate’s pane to interact with their session directly. Each teammate has a full view of their own terminal.
While you’re viewing an in-process teammate, plain text and
skills
go to that teammate, but built-in commands still run in the lead’s session.
A teammate’s model and fast mode are fixed when it spawns, so
/model
and
/fast
only change the lead’s settings. As of v2.1.199, typing either command while viewing a teammate shows a notice that the change applies to the lead; earlier versions applied it to the lead with no indication.
/effort
still applies to the viewed teammate’s later turns, because teammates follow the lead’s
effort level
.
​
Assign and claim tasks
The shared task list coordinates work across the team. The lead creates tasks and teammates work through them. Tasks have three states: pending, in progress, and completed. Tasks can also depend on other tasks: a pending task with unresolved dependencies cannot be claimed until those dependencies are completed.
Agents
without the Task tools
coordinate through messages instead of the shared task list.
The lead can assign tasks explicitly, or teammates can self-claim:
Lead assigns
: tell the lead which task to give to which teammate
Self-claim
: after finishing a task, a teammate picks up the next unassigned, unblocked task on its own
Task claiming uses file locking to prevent race conditions when multiple teammates try to claim the same task simultaneously.
​
Shut down teammates
To gracefully end a teammate’s session, refer to it by name. For example, with a teammate named researcher:
Ask the researcher teammate to shut down
The lead sends a shutdown request. The teammate can approve, exiting gracefully, or reject with an explanation.
The team’s shared directories are cleaned up automatically when the session ends, so there’s no separate cleanup step. See
Architecture
for which directories are removed and which persist for resumed sessions.
​
Enforce quality gates with hooks
Use
hooks
to enforce rules when teammates finish work or tasks are created or completed:
TeammateIdle
: runs when a teammate is about to go idle. Exit with code 2 to send feedback and keep the teammate working.
TaskCreated
: runs when a task is being created. Exit with code 2 to prevent creation and send feedback.
TaskCompleted
: runs when a task is being marked complete. Exit with code 2 to prevent completion and send feedback.
​
How agent teams work
This section covers the architecture and mechanics behind agent teams. If you want to start using them, see
Control your agent team
above.
​
How Claude starts agent teams
To start a team, ask Claude for teammates. Claude launches a teammate when it calls the
Agent tool
with a
name
while agent teams are enabled, unless the call is a
fork
or passes
isolation
on the call itself. Claude Code doesn’t ask you to confirm the launch.
Claude also names ordinary subagents on its own so it can message them later. Those calls follow the same rule, so teams can form even when you didn’t ask for one. If you want subagents instead,
turn agent teams off
.
​
Architecture
An agent team consists of:
Component
Role
Team lead
The main Claude Code session that spawns teammates and coordinates work
Teammates
Separate Claude Code instances that each work on assigned tasks
Task list
Shared list of work items that teammates claim and complete
Mailbox
Messaging system for communication between agents
Each agent’s mailbox is a JSON file at
~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/inboxes/{agent-name}.json
. Claude Code validates every entry when it reads a mailbox file. Entries that don’t match the message format are reported as errors and removed from the file; the valid messages are still delivered. Before v2.1.207, a single malformed mailbox entry caused a repeated error every second and blocked delivery for that mailbox until you deleted the file manually.
Claude Code reports a message as sent only when the write to the recipient’s mailbox file succeeds, whether the message is plain text or a structured protocol message such as a plan approval or shutdown request. When the write fails, for example because the disk is full or the mailbox directory isn’t writable, the sending agent receives an error and nothing is sent. See
Failed to write to a teammate’s inbox
for the error messages and recovery steps.
Claude Code manages task dependencies automatically: when a teammate completes a task that other tasks depend on, it unblocks the dependent tasks without any action from you.
Teams and tasks are stored locally under a session-derived name. The name is
session-
followed by the first eight characters of the session ID:
Team config
:
~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/config.json
Task list
:
~/.claude/tasks/{team-name}/
Claude Code generates both of these automatically at session startup and updates them as teammates join, go idle, or leave. The team config directory is removed when the session ends. The task list directory persists locally and is never uploaded, so resumed sessions keep their tasks. Retention is governed by the same
cleanupPeriodDays
you already control for session transcripts, following the
retention sweep rules
.
The team config holds runtime state such as session IDs and tmux pane IDs, so don’t edit it by hand or pre-author it: your changes are overwritten on the next state update.
To define reusable teammate roles, use
subagent definitions
instead.
The team config contains a
members
array with each member’s name and agent ID. The lead’s entry always carries the agent type
team-lead
. A teammate’s entry carries whatever agent type the lead named when spawning it, whether a
built-in type
or a
subagent definition
, and omits the field when the lead named none. Teammates can read this file to discover other team members.
There is no project-level equivalent of the team config. A file like
.claude/teams/teams.json
in your project directory is not recognized as configuration; Claude treats it as an ordinary file.
​
Use subagent definitions for teammates
When spawning a teammate in either display mode, you can reference a
subagent
type from the project, user, or managed
subagent scope
. This lets you define a role once, such as a security-reviewer or test-runner, and reuse it both as a delegated subagent and as an agent team teammate.
To use a subagent definition, name it when you ask Claude to spawn the teammate:
Spawn a teammate using the security-reviewer agent type to audit the auth module.
Claude Code reads the subagent definition you named and applies these parts of it to the teammate. Where a part depends on the teammate’s
display mode
, the entry says so:
tools
: Claude Code limits the teammate to the tools in the definition’s
tools
list. For an in-process teammate, Claude Code adds
SendMessage
to that list, and in a
session that has the Task tools
it adds
TaskCreate
,
TaskGet
,
TaskList
, and
TaskUpdate
too.
model
: Claude Code uses the definition’s
model
in either display mode when your spawn prompt doesn’t name one. See
how Claude Code picks a teammate’s model
.
Body
: for an in-process teammate, Claude Code appends the definition’s body to its default system prompt as additional instructions. For a split-pane teammate, Claude Code uses the body in place of its default system prompt.
skills
: Claude Code doesn’t apply the definition’s
skills
to a teammate in either display mode. The teammate loads skills from your project and user settings.
mcpServers
: for a split-pane teammate, Claude Code applies the definition’s
mcpServers
under the
rules for that field
, which cover a session started with
--agent
as well. An in-process teammate ignores the field and loads MCP servers from your project and user settings.
When Claude messages an in-process teammate that is no longer running, Claude Code brings it back in the same session, restores any conversation saved for it, and gives it the message as its next prompt. After you resume a session, teammates aren’t brought back this way, per
the resume limitation
.
For a teammate it brings back, Claude Code re-applies a definition that came from a project’s
.claude/agents/
directory or an
--add-dir
directory only if you’ve
trusted the folder the agent file is in
. Trusting a parent folder doesn’t count. Until then, the teammate comes back with none of the definition’s tools or instructions, keeping only the tools Claude Code adds to every in-process teammate. See
the teammate’s agent definition was not restored
for the notice text.
​
Permissions
Teammates start with the lead’s permission mode, except
dontAsk
mode
, which they don’t inherit. If the lead runs with
--dangerously-skip-permissions
, all teammates do too. After spawning, you can change an individual teammate’s permission mode, but you can’t set per-teammate permission modes at spawn time.
Teammate permission prompts appear in the lead session, so approve them there yourself.
Plan approval
is the designed exception: the lead session grants teammate plan approvals without a separate prompt to you.
​
Messages between agents
When one agent sends another a message over
SendMessage
, Claude Code tells the receiving agent the message came from another Claude session, not from you. A teammate can’t approve a permission prompt or supply consent on your behalf, and a teammate that was denied an action can’t relay it to another teammate to bypass the check. The same rules apply to a message that arrives from
one of your other Claude Code sessions
, outside the team entirely.
In
auto mode
, the classifier applies two checks to messages between agents:
It treats an approval claim relayed from another agent as untrusted input rather than confirmation from you.
It reviews each message before Claude Code delivers it, whether a plain message or a structured protocol message such as a shutdown request or plan approval response. A message it blocks never reaches the recipient.
​
Context and communication
Each teammate has its own context window. When spawned, a teammate loads the same project context as a regular session: CLAUDE.md, MCP servers, and skills. It also receives the spawn prompt from the lead. The lead’s conversation history does not carry over.
How teammates share information:
Automatic message delivery
: when teammates send messages, they’re delivered automatically to recipients. The lead doesn’t need to poll for updates.
Idle notifications
: when a teammate finishes and stops, it automatically notifies the lead and includes its final answer in the notification. A teammate whose turn ends on an API error notifies the lead that it failed and includes the error text.
Shared task list
:
agents that have the Task tools
can see task status and claim available work.
Teammate messaging
: send a message to one specific teammate by name. To reach everyone, send one message per recipient.
The lead assigns every teammate a name when it spawns them, and any teammate can message any other by that name. To get predictable names you can reference in later prompts, tell the lead what to call each teammate in your spawn instruction.
​
Token usage
Agent teams use significantly more tokens than a single session. Each teammate has its own context window, and token usage scales with the number of active teammates. For research, review, and new feature work, the extra tokens are usually worthwhile. For routine tasks, a single session is more cost-effective. See
agent team token costs
for usage guidance.
An in-process teammate’s requests fall outside the main conversation’s
cache TTL bucket
, so its cache holds for five minutes by default, including on a Claude subscription. To keep it for an hour, set
subagentPromptCacheTtl
to
1h
. The API bills 1-hour cache writes at a higher rate.
​
Use case examples
These examples show how agent teams handle tasks where parallel exploration adds value.
​
Run a parallel code review
A single reviewer tends to gravitate toward one type of issue at a time. Splitting review criteria into independent domains means security, performance, and test coverage all get thorough attention simultaneously. The prompt assigns each teammate a distinct lens so they don’t overlap:
Spawn three teammates to review PR #142:
- One focused on security implications
- One checking performance impact
- One validating test coverage
Have them each review and report findings.
Each reviewer works from the same PR but applies a different filter. The lead synthesizes findings across all three after they finish.
​
Investigate with competing hypotheses
When the root cause is unclear, a single agent tends to find one plausible explanation and stop looking. The prompt fights this by making teammates explicitly adversarial: each one’s job is not only to investigate its own theory but to challenge the others’.
Users report the app exits after one message instead of staying connected.
Spawn 5 agent teammates to investigate different hypotheses. Have them talk to
each other to try to disprove each other's theories, like a scientific
debate. Update the findings doc with whatever consensus emerges.
The debate structure is the key mechanism here. Sequential investigation suffers from anchoring: once one theory is explored, subsequent investigation is biased toward it.
With multiple independent investigators actively trying to disprove each other, the theory that survives is much more likely to be the actual root cause.
​
Best practices
​
Give teammates enough context
Teammates load project context automatically, including CLAUDE.md, MCP servers, and skills, but they don’t inherit the lead’s conversation history. See
Context and communication
for details. Include task-specific details in the spawn prompt:
Spawn a security reviewer teammate with the prompt: "Review the authentication module
at src/auth/ for security vulnerabilities. Focus on token handling, session
management, and input validation. The app uses JWT tokens stored in
httpOnly cookies. Report any issues with severity ratings."
​
Choose an appropriate team size
There’s no hard limit on the number of teammates, but practical constraints apply:
Token costs scale linearly
: each teammate has its own context window and consumes tokens independently. See
agent team token costs
for details.
Coordination overhead increases
: more teammates means more communication, task coordination, and potential for conflicts
Diminishing returns
: beyond a certain point, additional teammates don’t speed up work proportionally
Start with 3-5 teammates for most workflows. This balances parallel work with manageable coordination. If you have 15 independent tasks, 3 teammates is a good starting point.
Scale up only when the work benefits from having teammates work simultaneously. Three focused teammates often outperform five scattered ones.
​
Size tasks appropriately
Too small
: coordination overhead exceeds the benefit
Too large
: teammates work too long without check-ins, increasing risk of wasted effort
Just right
: self-contained units that produce a clear deliverable, such as a function, a test file, or a review
The lead breaks work into tasks and assigns them to teammates automatically. If it isn’t creating enough tasks, ask it to split the work into smaller pieces. Having 5-6 tasks per teammate keeps everyone productive and lets the lead reassign work if someone gets stuck.
​
Wait for teammates to finish
Sometimes the lead starts implementing tasks itself instead of waiting for teammates. If you notice this:
Wait for your teammates to complete their tasks before proceeding
​
Start with research and review
If you’re new to agent teams, start with tasks that have clear boundaries and don’t require writing code: reviewing a PR, researching a library, or investigating a bug. These tasks show the value of parallel exploration without the coordination challenges that come with parallel implementation.
​
Avoid file conflicts
Two teammates editing the same file leads to overwrites. Break the work so each teammate owns a different set of files.
​
Monitor and steer
Check in on teammates’ progress, redirect approaches that aren’t working, and synthesize findings as they come in. Letting a team run unattended for too long increases the risk of wasted effort.
​
Troubleshooting
​
Teammates not appearing
If teammates aren’t appearing after you ask Claude to spawn them:
In in-process mode, teammates appear in the agent panel below the prompt input. Use the up and down arrow keys to select one, then press Enter to view it.
A teammate row that disappeared after sitting idle has been hidden, not stopped. Idle rows hide 30 seconds after the whole panel goes idle and reappear on the teammate’s next turn. When more than three teammates are idle, their surplus rows collapse into a single
N idle agents
row that Enter expands. Send the teammate a message by name to bring a hidden row back.
Check that the task you gave Claude was complex enough to warrant a team. Claude decides whether to spawn teammates based on the task.
If you explicitly requested split panes, ensure tmux is installed and available in your PATH:
which
tmux
For iTerm2, verify the
it2
CLI is installed and the Python API is enabled in iTerm2 preferences.
​
Claude spawns teammates instead of subagents
While agent teams are enabled, a subagent that Claude names in the lead’s session launches as a teammate. Claude
can name subagents on its own
, so this can happen during delegation you never framed as team work.
To make named subagents launch as subagents again, turn agent teams off by setting
CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS
to
0
:
settings.json
{
"env"
: {
"CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS"
:
"0"
}
}
You don’t need to start a new session: Claude Code reapplies settings-file
env
values to the running session when you save, and rereads the variable each time Claude spawns a subagent, so the next subagent Claude names launches as a subagent.
Setting the variable to
0
in your user
settings.json
overrides a shell export. Other settings sources can still enable agent teams:
Higher-precedence settings files
: project settings, local settings, and a
--settings
payload apply after user settings, so an
env
entry that sets the variable to
1
in any of them wins. See
Settings precedence
.
Managed settings
:
managed settings
apply after every other source. If your organization enables agent teams there, ask your administrator to change the managed value.
After the change, Claude may still name subagents, and the name keeps working as a
SendMessage
address
. Claude receives each subagent’s result when it completes.
​
Too many permission prompts
Teammate permission requests bubble up to the lead, which can create friction. Pre-approve common operations in your
permission settings
before spawning teammates to reduce interruptions.
​
Agents stopping early
Teammates may stop after encountering errors instead of recovering. Check their output by selecting the teammate in the agent panel and pressing Enter in in-process mode, or by clicking the pane in split mode, then either:
Give them additional instructions directly
Spawn a replacement teammate to continue the work
A message from the lead or another teammate wakes an in-process teammate that is waiting to retry a failed API request, so it retries immediately instead of waiting for the full retry delay.
The lead can stop early too, deciding the team is finished before all tasks are actually complete. If that happens, tell it to keep going.
​
Orphaned tmux sessions
If a tmux session persists after the Claude Code session ends, it may not have been fully cleaned up. List sessions and end the one created by the team:
tmux
ls
tmux
kill-session
-t
<
session-nam
e
>
​
Limitations
Agent teams are experimental. Current limitations to be aware of:
No session resumption with in-process teammates
:
/resume
and
/rewind
do not restore in-process teammates. After resuming a session, the lead may attempt to message teammates that no longer exist. If this happens, tell the lead to spawn new teammates.
Task status can lag
: teammates sometimes fail to mark tasks as completed, which blocks dependent tasks. If a task appears stuck, check whether the work is actually done and update the task status manually or tell the lead to nudge the teammate.
Shutdown can be slow
: teammates finish their current request or tool call before shutting down, which can take time.
One team per session
: a session has exactly one team, scoped to that session. You can’t create additional named teams or share a team across sessions.
No nested teams
: teammates cannot spawn their own teammates. Only the lead can manage the team.
No background subagents from in-process teammates
: an in-process teammate’s own subagents run in the foreground, because a teammate’s background work can’t outlive the lead’s process. Claude Code returns an error when a teammate spawns a subagent whose definition sets
background: true
. A teammate’s
run_in_background: true
request also fails, either with an error or by running silently in the foreground, as described in
how Claude Code picks foreground or background
. Subagents launched from the main conversation follow the
background default
.
Lead is fixed
: the main session is the lead for its lifetime. You can’t promote a teammate to lead or transfer leadership.
Permissions set at spawn
: teammates start with the permission mode described under
Permissions
. You can change an individual teammate’s permission mode after spawning, but you can’t set per-teammate permission modes at spawn time.
Split panes require tmux or iTerm2
: the default in-process mode works in any terminal. Split-pane mode isn’t supported in VS Code’s integrated terminal, Windows Terminal, or Ghostty.

Commands control Claude Code from inside a session. They provide a quick way to switch models, manage permissions, clear context, run a workflow, and more.
Type
/
to see the commands available to you, or type
/
followed by letters to filter.
How the command menu matches what you type
covers highlighting, typos, and the few commands Claude Code hides from the menu until you type their full name.
A command is only recognized at the start of your message. Text that follows the command name becomes its arguments. As of v2.1.199,
skills
are the exception: a skill invocation followed by more skills, such as
/skill-a /skill-b do XYZ
, loads every skill named at the start and passes the trailing text to each as arguments. Up to six skills can be chained.
If you send a command while Claude is responding, Claude Code queues it and runs it after the current turn finishes. Claude Code runs some commands immediately without interrupting the response, such as
/status
,
/tasks
, and
/usage
. In
fullscreen rendering
, Claude Code also opens dialog commands such as
/theme
and
/help
immediately. Before v2.1.234, Claude Code queued those dialogs until the turn finished.
​
Commands across a typical workflow
Most commands are useful at a specific point in a session, from setting up a project to shipping a change.
First session in a repo.
Run
/init
to generate a starter
CLAUDE.md
, then
/memory
to refine it. Use
/mcp
to set up any servers the project needs, ask Claude to create any
subagents
you want, and run
/permissions
to set your approval rules.
During a task.
/plan
switches into plan mode before a large change.
/model
and
/effort
adjust which model you’re using and how much reasoning it applies. When the conversation gets long,
/context
shows what’s filling the window and
/compact
summarizes it to free space. Use
/btw
for a side question that shouldn’t add to the conversation history.
Run work in parallel.
Claude delegates side tasks to
subagents
, and
/tasks
lists the current session’s background work, including subagents that have finished.
/background
detaches the whole session to keep running as a
background agent
and frees your terminal. For a large change that spans the codebase,
/batch
decomposes it into independent units and runs each in its own
worktree
. See
Run agents in parallel
for how these approaches relate.
Before you ship.
/diff
shows what changed.
/code-review
checks the current diff for correctness bugs and cleanups and can apply the findings with
--fix
; pass a PR number, such as
/code-review high 1234
, to review a pull request instead.
/review
is an alias.
/code-review ultra
runs a multi-agent review in the cloud.
/security-review
checks the diff for security vulnerabilities.
Between sessions.
/clear
starts fresh on a new task while keeping project memory.
/resume
returns to an earlier conversation,
/branch
branches the current one to try a different direction, and
/fork
copies it into a new
background session
.
/teleport
pulls a cloud session into this terminal, and
/remote-control
lets you continue this local session from another device.
When something is wrong.
/rewind
rolls code and conversation back to a checkpoint, or summarizes part of the conversation.
/doctor
runs a setup checkup that diagnoses installation and configuration issues and can fix them,
/debug
diagnoses runtime issues, and
/feedback
reports a bug with session context attached.
​
All commands
The table below lists all the commands included in Claude Code. Most are built-in commands whose behavior is coded into the CLI. Two kinds of entries are marked:
Skill
: a bundled skill. It works like skills you write yourself: a prompt handed to Claude.
/verify
runs only when you invoke it. Before v2.1.215, Claude could also run
/verify
on its own.
Workflow
: a bundled
dynamic workflow
that fans work out across many subagents and runs in the background.
/deep-research
runs only when you invoke it. Before v2.1.218, Claude could also start it on its own.
To add your own commands, see
skills
.
In the table below,
<arg>
indicates a required argument and
[arg]
indicates an optional one.
Not every command appears for every user. Availability depends on your platform, plan, and environment. For example,
/desktop
only shows on macOS and x64 Windows when signed in with a Claude subscription, and
/upgrade
doesn’t show on Enterprise plans.
Command
Purpose
/add-dir <path>
Add a working directory for file access during the current session. Type a partial path to see matching directory suggestions; press
Tab
to accept one. Most
.claude/
configuration
isn’t discovered
from the added directory. You can’t add most
network paths
, such as
\\server\share
. After a successful add, your
DirectoryAdded
hooks
run. When you run it while Claude is responding, Claude Code asks you to confirm the directory right away, and once you confirm, Claude’s next tool call in the same turn can access it. Before v2.1.234, Claude Code queued the command until the turn finished
/advisor [model|off]
Enable or disable the
advisor tool
, which consults a second model for guidance at key moments during a task. Accepts
fable
,
opus
,
sonnet
, or a full model ID.
fable
requires
Fable access
. Without an argument, opens a picker. In a session without an interactive terminal, or over
Remote Control
, pass the model or
off
as an argument; with no argument there, the command prints the current advisor as text. These forms require Claude Code v2.1.260 or later
/agents
As of v2.1.198, running
/agents
prints a reminder to ask Claude to create or manage
subagents
, or to edit
.claude/agents/
or
~/.claude/agents/
directly. On v2.1.197 and earlier, opens an interactive interface for creating and managing subagent configurations
/artifacts
List the
artifacts
you own or that are shared with you, then attach one to the session, open it in your browser, or copy its link. Available where
artifacts
are. Requires Claude Code v2.1.208 or later; attaching with
Enter
requires v2.1.216
/auto-mode-setup
Draft
autoMode.environment
entries
from your project and recent sessions, then review the draft and save it to your user settings. Requires a Pro, Max, or Team plan and Claude Code v2.1.228 or later. On native Windows, requires v2.1.233 or later
/autocompact [auto|<tokens>]
Set the auto-compact window: how full the context window gets before Claude Code compacts automatically. Pass a size such as
500k
, or
auto
to return to the window tuned for your model. Claude Code saves the value to user settings and applies it to the current session. See
Set the auto-compact window
for accepted values and what overrides it. Without an argument, opens a dialog that shows the current window. Requires Claude Code v2.1.221 or later
/autofix-pr [prompt]
Spawn a
cloud session
that watches the current branch’s PR and pushes fixes when CI fails or reviewers leave comments. Detects the open PR from your checked-out branch with
gh pr view
; to watch a different PR, check out its branch first. By default the cloud session is told to fix every CI failure and review comment; pass a prompt to give it different instructions, for example
/autofix-pr only fix lint and type errors
. Requires the
gh
CLI and access to
cloud sessions
/background [prompt]
Detach the current session to run as a
background agent
and free this terminal. Pass a prompt to send one more instruction before detaching. Monitor the session with
claude agents
. To copy the conversation into a new background session while this one keeps running, use
/fork
. Alias:
/bg
/batch <instruction>
Skill
.
Orchestrate large-scale changes across a codebase in parallel. Researches the codebase, decomposes the work into 5 to 30 independent units, and presents a plan. Once approved, spawns one
background subagent
per unit in an isolated
git worktree
. Each subagent implements its unit, runs tests, and opens a pull request. Requires a git repository. Example:
/batch migrate src/ from JavaScript to TypeScript
/branch [name]
Create a branch of the current conversation at this point, so you can try a different direction without losing the conversation as it stands. Switches you into the branch and preserves the original, which you can return to with
/resume
. To run a copy as a separate
background session
instead of switching into it, use
/fork
; to hand a side task to a
subagent
that reports back into this conversation, use
/subtask
/btw [question]
Ask a
side question
about the current session without adding to the conversation. If you run
/btw
without a question, Claude Code shows your most recent side question so you can browse earlier answers; if you haven’t asked one yet, Claude Code prints a usage line. Before v2.1.212,
/btw
required a question
/bug [report]
Report a bug or share your conversation. You choose how much session history to include and confirm on a consent screen before anything is sent. When you’re signed in to Anthropic on a first-party connection, the report goes to Anthropic; on a third-party provider, or without Anthropic credentials, Claude Code writes the report to a
local archive under
~/.claude/feedback-bundles/
that you forward yourself. In the
VS Code extension
,
/bug
opens the extension’s own feedback dialog instead; requires Claude Code v2.1.229 or later. When you run it while Claude is responding, Claude Code opens the dialog immediately. Before v2.1.232, Claude Code queued the command until the turn finished. Alias:
/share
. Before v2.1.212,
/bug
and
/share
were aliases of
/feedback
/cd <path>
Move this session to a new working directory, keeping the conversation. Type a partial path to see matching directory suggestions; press
Tab
to accept one. The suggestions require Claude Code v2.1.206 or later. For what Claude Code applies from the new directory as soon as you move, and how
/cd
differs from
/add-dir
, see

prompt-audit
to flag instructions written for older models in your prompts, skills, and tool descriptions and propose fixes as a diff. Run
cost-optimize
to profile where your project’s Claude API spend goes and propose savings from options such as prompt caching, trimming unneeded input and output tokens, batch processing, effort, and model choice, one change at a time. Run
build-eval
to build an eval set for your Claude-powered app, and
hillclimb
to iteratively improve the app against an existing eval. The
prompt-audit
subcommand requires Claude Code v2.1.221 or later,
upgrade
requires v2.1.236 or later,
cost-optimize
requires v2.1.247 or later, and
build-eval
and
hillclimb
require v2.1.259 or later
/clear [name]
Start a new conversation with empty context. Pass a name to label the previous conversation in the
/resume
picker. To free up context while continuing the same conversation, use
/compact
instead. Resume the previous conversation with
/resume
, or, in the same Claude Code process, restore it from
the rewind menu’s previous-session entry
. The rewind entry requires Claude Code v2.1.191 or later. Aliases:
/reset
,
/new
/code-review [low|medium|high|xhigh|max|ultra] [--fix] [--comment] [pr#|branch|path]
Skill
.
Review the current diff, or a PR number, branch, or path you pass, for correctness bugs and cleanup opportunities. Pass
--fix
to apply findings,
--comment
to post them on the GitHub PR or GitLab merge request, or
ultra
to run a deep
cloud review
. Posting to a GitLab merge request requires Claude Code v2.1.257 or later. With
ultra
on a
github.com
PR target, pass
--post
to preselect
posting the finished findings to the PR
in the launch dialog;
--post
requires Claude Code v2.1.227 or later. See
Review a diff locally
for the effort levels, targeting, and how it relates to
/simplify
. Alias:
/review
/color [color|default]
Set the prompt bar color for the current session. Available colors:
red
,
blue
,
green
,
yellow
,
purple
,
orange
,
pink
,
cyan
. Use
default
to reset, or run with no argument to pick a random color. When
Remote Control
is connected, the color syncs to claude.ai/code. Also available in non-interactive mode (
-p
); requires Claude Code v2.1.205 or later
/compact [instructions]
Free up context by summarizing the conversation so far. Optionally pass focus instructions for the summary. See
how compaction handles rules, skills, and memory files
/config [key=value ...]
Open the
Settings
interface to adjust theme, model,
output style
, and other preferences. Pass one or more
key=value
pairs to set a setting directly without opening the interface, for example
/config thinking=false
,
/config theme=dark
, or
/config model=sonnet
. The
key=value
form also works in non-interactive mode (
-p
) and from the Claude mobile app via
Remote Control
. The
key=value
form can’t turn on a setting that needs your confirmation in the panel, such as
autoContinueAtUsageLimit
, though it can turn one off. Run
/config --help
to list the keys it accepts. Alias:
/settings
/context [all]
Visualize current context usage as a colored grid. Shows optimization suggestions for context-heavy tools, memory bloat, and capacity warnings. When the conversation exceeds the context window, the output includes a
warning
showing how far over the limit you are and which command frees space. In
fullscreen mode
,
/context
collapses the per-item breakdown to keep the grid visible. Pass
all
to expand it
/copy [N]
Copy the last assistant response to clipboard. Pass a number
N
to copy the Nth-latest response:
/copy 2
copies the second-to-last. When code blocks are present, shows an interactive picker to select individual blocks or the full response. Press
w
in the picker to write the selection to a file instead of the clipboard, which is useful over SSH
/cost
Alias for
/usage
/dataviz [request]
Skill
.
Design guidance for charts, graphs, and dashboards. Claude picks the chart form for the data, assigns color by role, validates the palette for colorblind safety and contrast with a bundled script, and applies mark, interaction, and accessibility rules. Uses a brand-neutral placeholder palette that you replace with your own. Requires Claude Code v2.1.198 or later
/debug [description]
Skill
.
Enable debug logging for the current session and troubleshoot issues by reading the session debug log. Debug logging is off by default unless you started with
claude --debug
, so running
/debug
mid-session starts capturing logs from that point forward. Optionally describe the issue to focus the analysis
/deep-research <question>
Workflow
.
Fan out web searches on a question, fetch and cross-check sources, and synthesize a cited report
/design [brief]
Skill
.
Draft UI mockups, screen flows, landing pages, or posters as artboards on one canvas, published as a Design
artifact
, for example
/design a settings screen for a mobile banking app
. You edit the artboards in a desktop browser, and your edits save automatically. You can export each artboard as PNG or PDF. Requires a session where
artifacts are available
and Claude Code v2.1.265 or later. Available on the Anthropic API. On Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud’s Agent Platform, Microsoft Foundry, and Claude Platform on AWS, artifacts aren’t available, so the command is unavailable there
/design-login
Authorize design-system access for
/design-sync
with your claude.ai account
/design-sync [hint]
Skill
.
Convert your repo’s React design system and upload it to
Claude Design
, so designs it produces use your real components. Optionally name the design system, for example
/design-sync Acme DS
. A first-time sync verifies every component and can take a few hours on a large repo. Available on the Anthropic API. It needs claude.ai, which the CLI doesn’t contact on Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud’s Agent Platform, Microsoft Foundry, or Claude Platform on AWS, or through a
Claude apps gateway
, so the command is unavailable there
/desktop
Continue the current session in the Claude Code Desktop app. Requires macOS or x64 Windows and a Claude subscription. Alias:
/app
/diff
Review the changes in your working tree, including the edits Claude has made so far. See
Review changes with /diff
/doctor
Skill
.
Run a setup checkup that diagnoses issues and can fix them. Checks installation health, including duplicate or leftover installs,
PATH
problems, and unparseable settings files. Finds unused skills, MCP servers, and plugins versus their context cost, flags slow
hooks
, and checks for a newer version on your
release channel
. Deduplicates local
CLAUDE.md
files against checked-in ones, trims checked-in
CLAUDE.md
files by cutting content Claude could derive from the codebase, and migrates the always-loaded guidance that remains into
skills
and nested
CLAUDE.md
files that load on demand. Also offers to make
auto mode
your default and to
pre-approve
frequently denied read-only commands. Reports findings first and asks for confirmation before changing anything. From the terminal,
claude doctor
prints read-only installation diagnostics without starting a session. Alias:
/checkup
. The
CLAUDE.md
trim check requires Claude Code v2.1.206 or later. Before v2.1.205,
/doctor
opened a read-only diagnostics screen and pressing
f
sent the report to Claude
/effort [level|auto|status]
Set the
effort level
:
low
to
xhigh
,
max
,
ultracode
, or
auto
;
status
prints it.
max
and
ultracode
are session-only; the
ultracode
key persists. Run it while Claude is responding and, once you confirm the
cache warning
, if Claude Code shows one, Claude Code applies the new level to the next request in that turn. Before v2.1.242, Claude Code decided from a feature flag it fetched from Anthropic whether to run the command mid-turn or queue it until the turn finished, and always queued it in a session that doesn’t
fetch feature flags
, such as on a
third-party provider
. Works in
-p
outside the
effort hold
/exit
Exit the CLI. In an attached
background session
, this detaches and the session keeps running. Alias:
/quit
/export [filename]
Export the current conversation as plain text. With a filename, writes directly to that file. Without, opens a dialog to copy to clipboard or save to a file
/fast [on|off]
Toggle
fast mode
on or off. Run it while Claude is responding and Claude Code toggles fast mode without waiting for the turn to end, though the running turn finishes at its original speed. Before v2.1.242, Claude Code decided from a feature flag it fetched from Anthropic whether to run the command mid-turn or queue it until the turn finished, and always queued it in a session that doesn’t
fetch feature flags
. Availability in non-interactive mode with
-p
is limited; see
Toggle fast mode
. Requires Claude Code v2.1.205 or later
/feedback [report]
Send product feedback about Claude Code. Opens the same dialog as
/bug
, with the same consent step, sending rules, and mid-turn behavior. In sessions with
Claude-drafted feedback
,
/feedback
with no argument opens the drafts queue instead, where you review, edit, send, or discard the drafts Claude queued; the queue includes an option to write a new report in the dialog. With an argument, and for
/bug
always, the dialog opens directly
/fewer-permission-prompts
Skill
.
Scan your transcripts for common read-only Bash and MCP tool calls, then add a prioritized allowlist to project
.claude/settings.json
to reduce permission prompts
/focus
Toggle the focus view, which shows only your last prompt, a one-line tool-call summary with edit diffstats, and the final response. The tool-call summary also counts the subagents launched in the turn and collapses completed background-task notifications into a single count. The selection persists across sessions; set
viewMode
in settings to override it. Only available in
fullscreen rendering
. The
VS Code extension
offers its own Focus view as a command-menu toggle, stored as an extension setting, independent of
viewMode
/fork [prompt]
Copy the current conversation
into a new background session and keep working here. Pass a prompt and the copy starts working on it immediately; without one it waits in agent view for its first prompt. Except when the copy
edits in place
, Claude Code instructs it to create a worktree of its own before making code changes; the isolation instruction requires Claude Code v2.1.221 or later. To hand a side task to a subagent whose result comes back into this conversation, use
/subtask
; to switch into a copy yourself, use
/branch
. Requires Claude Code v2.1.212 or later; on v2.1.161 through v2.1.211, and whenever
agent view is turned off
,
/fork
starts a
forked subagent
instead
/goal [condition|clear]
Set a
goal
: Claude keeps working across turns until the condition is met or the goal
clears for another reason
. With no argument, shows the current or most recently achieved goal.
clear
,
stop
,
off
,
reset
,
none
, or
cancel
removes an active goal early
/heapdump
Write a JavaScript heap snapshot and a memory breakdown to
~/Desktop
, or your home directory on Linux without a Desktop folder, for diagnosing high memory usage. Attach only the
-diagnostics.json
file when reporting a memory issue; the
.heapsnapshot
contains your full conversation and credentials, so don’t share it.

--dry-run
to preview without writing anything, or
--yes
to skip the interactive picker. Not available on Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud’s Agent Platform, Microsoft Foundry, or Claude Platform on AWS, or through a
Claude apps gateway
. Also unavailable when you turn off
feature-flag fetching
. Requires Claude Code v2.1.213 or later. Importing from Cursor requires v2.1.265 or later
/init
Initialize project with a
CLAUDE.md

/model [model]
Switch the AI model and save it as your default for new sessions. For models that support it, use left/right arrows to
adjust effort level
. With no argument, opens a picker; press
s
on a row to switch for the current session only. See
when Claude Code asks you to confirm the switch
. Once you confirm the switch, if Claude Code asks, Claude Code applies the change without waiting for the current response to finish. Before v2.1.242, Claude Code decided from a feature flag it fetched from Anthropic whether to run the command mid-turn or queue it until the turn finished, and always queued it in a session that doesn’t
fetch feature flags
, such as on a
third-party provider
. Also available in non-interactive mode (
-p
) with a model argument instead of the picker, where it applies to the current session only and isn’t saved as your default; requires Claude Code v2.1.205 or later
/output-style [style]
List
output styles
or switch to one, for example
/output-style concise

/permissions
Manage allow, ask, and deny rules for tool permissions. Opens an interactive dialog where you can view rules by scope, add or remove rules, manage working directories, and review
recent auto mode denials
. You can also view and edit
auto mode classifier rules
from the dialog’s
Auto mode
tab. When you run it while Claude is responding, Claude Code opens the dialog immediately and applies your changes starting with Claude’s next tool call in the same turn. Before v2.1.234, Claude Code queued the command until the turn finished. Alias:
/allowed-tools
/plan [description]
Enter plan mode directly from the prompt. Pass an optional description to enter plan mode and immediately start with that task, for example
/plan fix the auth bug
/plugin [subcommand]
Manage Claude Code
plugins
. Run with no argument to open the plugin menu, or pass a subcommand such as
list

to act directly. Claude Code can activate a plugin during the install; the
install summary
tells you whether it did or whether to run
/reload-plugins
/powerup
Discover Claude Code features through quick interactive lessons with animated demos
/pr-comments [PR]
Removed in v2.1.91. Ask Claude directly to view pull request comments instead. On earlier versions, fetches and displays comments from a GitHub pull request; automatically detects the PR for the current branch, or pass a PR URL or number. Requires the
gh
CLI
/privacy-settings
View and update your privacy settings. Only available for Pro and Max plan subscribers
/radio
Open Claude FM lo-fi radio in your browser. Prints the stream URL when no browser is available
/rate-limit-options

Session recap
for the automatic recap that appears after you’ve been away
/release-notes
View the changelog in an interactive version picker. Select a specific version to see its release notes, or choose to show all versions. The notes appear in your transcript without entering the conversation Claude sees
/reload-plugins [--force]
Reload all active
plugins
to apply pending changes without restarting. Reports counts for each reloaded component and flags any load errors. When the reload would change which MCP tools are loaded and invalidate the prompt cache, the command warns and skips unless you pass
--force
. Also available in non-interactive mode (
-p
), the Agent SDK, and the desktop app, where it runs only on input typed directly into the session and doesn’t apply plugin MCP server changes; requires Claude Code v2.1.260 or later. See
Apply plugin changes without restarting
/reload-skills
Re-scan
skill
and command directories so skills added or changed on disk during the session become available without restarting. Reports how many skills are available and how many were added or removed
/remote-control
Make this session available for
Remote Control
from claude.ai. Running it while signed out prints that Remote Control requires a claude.ai subscription and tells you how to sign in; before v2.1.206 it reported
Unknown command: /remote-control
. Alias:
/rc
/remote-env
Choose the default
cloud environment
for cloud sessions you start from the CLI
/rename [name]
Rename the current session and show the name on the prompt bar. Without a name, auto-generates one from conversation history. Also available in non-interactive mode (
-p
); requires Claude Code v2.1.205 or later. From every rename surface, including claude.ai and the desktop app, Claude Code replaces control and invisible characters in the new name with spaces and caps the name at 200 characters. If the name is empty once invisible characters are removed, Claude Code rejects it and shows
That name is empty once invisible characters are removed. Usage: /rename <name>
. The character replacement and length cap require Claude Code v2.1.221 or later. If another live session on this machine already uses a name you pass, Claude Code applies
a variant of it
instead
/resume [session]
Resume a conversation by ID or name, or open the session picker.
Background sessions
appear in the picker marked with
bg

progress view to watch, pause, resume, or save running and completed workflows
​
How the command menu matches what you type
Claude Code filters the
/
menu as you type. Each bullet below covers one thing you might notice while filtering:
Highlighting
: Claude Code highlights the top suggestion only when the letters after the
/
match a command’s name or alias, from the start of the name or from a word within it, ignoring the
:
,
_
, and
-
separators. Typing
/adddir
highlights
/add-dir
, and typing
/new
highlights
/clear
through its alias. Press
Enter
to run the highlighted suggestion. These highlighting rules require Claude Code v2.1.236 or later.
After a typo
: Claude Code highlights nothing. The close matches stay listed, and you can pick one with
Tab
or the arrow keys, but
Enter
submits your text as typed and reports
Unknown command
.
Commands that aren’t available to you
: Claude Code leaves them out of the menu. When nothing matches, Claude Code shows
No commands match "/name"
. Most unavailable commands return
Unknown command
when you submit them; a few, such as
/schedule
on a Console API key
, answer with their own availability message instead. Some commands also answer with a message of their own when your organization’s policy disables them.
Hidden commands
: Claude Code keeps a few available commands, such as
/heapdump
, out of the menu by design. A partial name never brings a hidden command into the menu: if the partial matches nothing visible, Claude Code shows the same no-match message. Claude Code lists the command only once you’ve typed its full name, and submitting the full name runs it.

Skip to main content
Plugins let you extend Claude Code with custom functionality that can be shared across projects and teams. This guide covers creating your own plugins with skills, agents, hooks, and MCP servers.
Looking to install existing plugins? See
Discover and install plugins
. For complete technical specifications, see
Plugins reference
.
​
When to use plugins vs standalone configuration
Claude Code supports two ways to add custom skills, agents, and hooks:
Approach
Skill names
Best for
Standalone
(
.claude/
directory)
/hello
Personal workflows, project-specific customizations, quick experiments
Plugins
(self-contained directories with skills, agents, hooks, or a
.claude-plugin/plugin.json
manifest)
/plugin-name:hello
Sharing with teammates, distributing to community, versioned releases, reusable across projects
Start with standalone configuration in
.claude/
for quick iteration, then
convert to a plugin
when you’re ready to share.
​
Quickstart
This quickstart walks you through creating a plugin with a custom skill. You’ll create a manifest (the configuration file that defines your plugin), add a skill, and test it locally using the
--plugin-dir
flag.
​
Prerequisites
Claude Code
installed and authenticated
​
Create your first plugin
1
Create the plugin directory
Every plugin lives in its own directory containing your skills, agents, or hooks, optionally alongside a
.claude-plugin/plugin.json
manifest. The location doesn’t matter for this quickstart because you’ll point Claude Code at the directory with
--plugin-dir
in the test step. Create it anywhere convenient, such as a scratch folder or a projects directory:
mkdir
my-first-plugin
The remaining steps run from the parent directory and reference paths like
my-first-plugin/...
relative to it.
2
Create the plugin manifest
The manifest file at
.claude-plugin/plugin.json
defines your plugin’s identity: its name, description, and version. Claude Code uses this metadata to display your plugin in the plugin manager.
Create the
.claude-plugin
directory inside your plugin folder:
mkdir
my-first-plugin/.claude-plugin
Then create
my-first-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
with this content:
my-first-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
{
"name"
:
"my-first-plugin"
,
"description"
:
"A greeting plugin to learn the basics"
,
"version"
:
"1.0.0"
,
"author"
: {
"name"
:
"Your Name"
}
}
Field
Purpose
name
Unique identifier and skill namespace. Skills are prefixed with this (e.g.,
/my-first-plugin:hello
).
description
Shown in the plugin manager when browsing or installing plugins.
version
Optional. If set, users only receive updates when you bump this field, except for a
command
source
or a plugin
loaded in place
; see
version management
. If omitted, the version comes from the next source in
version management
.
author
Optional. Helpful for attribution.
For additional fields like
homepage
,
repository
, and
license
, see the
full manifest schema
.
3
Add a skill
Skills live in the
skills/
directory. Each skill is a folder containing a
SKILL.md
file. The folder name becomes the skill name, prefixed with the plugin’s namespace (
hello/
in a plugin named
my-first-plugin
creates
/my-first-plugin:hello
).
Create a skill directory in your plugin folder:
mkdir
-p
my-first-plugin/skills/hello
Then create
my-first-plugin/skills/hello/SKILL.md
with this content:
my-first-plugin/skills/hello/SKILL.md
---
description
:
Greet the user with a friendly message
disable-model-invocation
:
true
---
Greet the user warmly and ask how you can help them today.
4
Test your plugin
Run Claude Code with the
--plugin-dir
flag to load your plugin:
claude
--plugin-dir
./my-first-plugin
Once Claude Code starts, try your new skill:
/my-first-plugin:hello
You’ll see Claude respond with a greeting. Run
/help
and open the
Custom commands
tab to see your skill listed under the plugin namespace.
Why namespacing?
Plugin skills are always namespaced (like
/my-first-plugin:hello
) to prevent conflicts when multiple plugins have skills with the same name.
To change the namespace prefix, update the
name
field in
plugin.json
.
5
Add skill arguments
Make your skill dynamic by accepting user input. The
$ARGUMENTS
placeholder captures any text the user provides after the skill name.
Update your
SKILL.md
file:
my-first-plugin/skills/hello/SKILL.md
---
description
:
Greet the user with a personalized message

# Hello Skill
Greet the user named "$ARGUMENTS" warmly and ask how you can help them today. Make the greeting personal and encouraging.
Run
/reload-plugins
to pick up the changes. Then try the skill with your name:
/my-first-plugin:hello
Alex
Claude will greet you by name. For more on passing arguments to skills, see
Skills
.
The
--plugin-dir
flag is useful for development and testing. When you’re ready to share your plugin with others, see
Create and distribute a plugin marketplace
.
​
Develop a plugin in your skills directory
Instead of passing
--plugin-dir
on every launch, you can keep a plugin in your skills directory and have Claude Code load it automatically.
claude plugin init
scaffolds one:
claude
plugin
init
my-tool
This creates
~/.claude/skills/my-tool/
with a
.claude-plugin/plugin.json
manifest and a starter
SKILL.md
. On the next session it loads as
my-tool@skills-dir
with no marketplace or install step.
For the auto-load rules, personal vs. project scope, the workspace-trust requirement, and how to update or remove one, see
Skills-directory plugins
.
​
Plugin structure overview
You’ve created a plugin with a skill, but plugins can include much more: custom agents, hooks, MCP servers, LSP servers, and background monitors.
Common mistake
: Don’t put
commands/
,
agents/
,
skills/
, or
hooks/
inside the
.claude-plugin/
directory. Only
plugin.json
goes inside
.claude-plugin/
. All other directories must be at the plugin root level.
The plugin root is the individual plugin’s own directory, such as
my-first-plugin/
from the
quickstart
. It is never
~/.claude/
. For example, Claude Code doesn’t read a
.mcp.json
placed at
~/.claude/.mcp.json
.
Directory
Location
Purpose
.claude-plugin/
Plugin root
Contains
plugin.json
manifest (optional if components use default locations)
skills/

Skills as
<name>/SKILL.md
directories
commands/

Skills as flat Markdown files. Use
skills/

Executables added to the Bash tool’s
PATH
while the plugin is enabled. You can’t include this directory in a plugin you
distribute through claude.ai organization settings
settings.json
Plugin root
Default
settings
applied when the plugin is enabled
A plugin that ships exactly one skill can place
SKILL.md
directly at the plugin root instead of creating a
skills/
directory. Claude Code loads it as a single skill and uses the frontmatter
name
field for the invocation name. Use the
skills/
layout for plugins that may grow to more than one skill.
​
Develop more complex plugins
Once you’re comfortable with basic plugins, you can create more sophisticated extensions.
​
Add Skills to your plugin
Plugins can include
Agent Skills
to extend Claude’s capabilities. Skills are model-invoked: Claude automatically uses them based on the task context.
Add a
skills/
directory at your plugin root with Skill folders containing
SKILL.md
files:
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json
└── skills/
└── code-review/
└── SKILL.md
Each
SKILL.md
contains YAML frontmatter and instructions. Include a
description
so Claude knows when to use the skill:
---
description
:
Reviews code for best practices and potential issues. Use when reviewing code, checking PRs, or analyzing code quality.
---
When reviewing code, check for
:
1. Code organization and structure
2. Error handling
3. Security concerns
4. Test coverage
After you install the plugin, check the install summary: if it reports
Run /reload-plugins to activate.
, see
Apply plugin changes without restarting
to load the Skills in your current session. For complete Skill authoring guidance including progressive disclosure and tool restrictions, see
Agent Skills
.
​
Add LSP servers to your plugin
For common languages like TypeScript, Python, and Rust, install the pre-built LSP plugins from the official marketplace. Create custom LSP plugins only when you need support for languages not already covered.
LSP (Language Server Protocol) plugins give Claude real-time code intelligence. If you need to support a language that doesn’t have an official LSP plugin, you can create your own by adding an
.lsp.json
file to your plugin:
.lsp.json
{
"go"
: {
"command"
:
"gopls"
,
"args"
: [
"serve"
],
"extensionToLanguage"
: {
".go"
:
"go"
}
}
}
Users installing your plugin must have the language server binary installed on their machine.
To confirm the server starts, launch Claude Code with the plugin enabled and check the
/plugin
Errors tab: a language server that fails to start appears there, for example with
Executable not found in $PATH
when the binary isn’t installed. An entry with an invalid configuration is skipped instead; run
claude --debug
to see why.
For complete LSP configuration options, see
LSP servers
.
​
Add background monitors to your plugin
Background monitors let your plugin watch logs, files, or external status in the background and notify Claude as events arrive. Claude Code starts each monitor automatically when the plugin is active, so you don’t need to instruct Claude to start the watch.
Add a
monitors/monitors.json
file at the plugin root with an array of monitor entries:
monitors/monitors.json
[
{
"name"
:
"error-log"
,
"command"
:
"tail -F ./logs/error.log"
,
"description"
:
"Application error log"
}
]
Each stdout line from
command
is delivered to Claude as a notification during the session. For the full schema, including the
when
trigger and variable substitution, see
Monitors
.
​
Ship default settings with your plugin
Plugins can include a
settings.json
file at the plugin root to apply default configuration when the plugin is enabled. Currently, only the
agent
and
subagentStatusLine
keys are supported.
Setting
agent
activates one of the plugin’s
custom agents
as the main thread, applying its system prompt, tool restrictions, and model. This lets a plugin change how Claude Code behaves by default when enabled.
settings.json
{
"agent"
:
"security-reviewer"
}
This example activates the
security-reviewer
agent defined in the plugin’s
agents/
directory. Settings from
settings.json
take priority over
settings
declared in
plugin.json
. Unknown keys are silently ignored.
​
Organize complex plugins
For plugins with many components, organize your directory structure by functionality. For complete directory layouts and organization patterns, see
Plugin directory structure
.
​
Test your plugins locally
Use the
--plugin-dir
flag to test plugins during development. This loads your plugin directly without requiring installation.
claude
--plugin-dir
./my-plugin
The flag also accepts a
.zip
archive of the plugin directory.
claude
--plugin-dir
./my-plugin.zip
When a
--plugin-dir
plugin has the same name as an installed marketplace plugin, the local copy takes precedence for that session. This lets you test changes to a plugin you already have installed without uninstalling it first. The exception is plugins that managed settings force-enable or force-disable:
--plugin-dir
cannot override those.
As you make changes to your plugin, run
/reload-plugins
to pick up the updates without restarting. This reloads plugins, skills, agents, hooks, plugin MCP servers, and plugin LSP servers; in a session without an interactive terminal, plugin MCP server changes
wait for your next session
. Test your plugin components:
Try your skills with
/plugin-name:skill-name
Check that agents appear in
/context
under Custom Agents, or @-mention one by its scoped name
Trigger the event each hook matches, such as asking Claude to edit a file for a
PostToolUse
hook, and confirm its effect. Claude Code records which hooks matched, their exit codes, and their output in the
debug log
You can load multiple plugins at once by specifying the flag multiple times:
claude
--plugin-dir
./plugin-one
--plugin-dir
./plugin-two
To test a plugin together with a plugin it depends on, see
Test a plugin and its dependency locally
.
Trying the plugin with
--plugin-dir
tells you it can work. To find out how often Claude actually reaches for it and gets the right result, run it against a set of test prompts with
claude plugin eval
. Each prompt runs several times with and without the plugin loaded, so you can see what the plugin contributes and catch regressions when you change it or a new model ships.
To load several plugins from one place, pass a folder that holds them, such as
--plugin-dir ./plugins
. Loading a folder of plugins requires Claude Code v2.1.265 or later. Claude Code reads the folder’s top level to decide which plugins load, and in an interactive session it also watches the folder for later changes:
What loads
: if the folder has no manifest or plugin components at its top level, Claude Code treats it as a folder of plugins. Each immediate subfolder that has a
.claude-plugin/plugin.json
manifest loads as a separate plugin. Claude Code skips everything else in the folder without reporting an error, including plugins that have no manifest.
Changes during an interactive session
: a subfolder you add loads as a new plugin once its manifest is in place, and when you remove a subfolder, its plugin unloads. Claude Code prints a line in the session for each change. If applying a change mid-conversation would
invalidate the prompt cache
, Claude Code holds it, and the line says to run
/reload-plugins
to apply it.
To test a plugin that is already packaged as a
.zip
archive and hosted at a URL, such as a CI build artifact, use
--plugin-url
instead. Claude Code fetches the archive at startup and loads it for that session only. If Claude Code can’t fetch the archive, or the archive is invalid, it starts without the plugin and records a plugin load error that you can review in the
/plugin
manager’s
Errors
tab. The same
trust considerations
apply as for any plugin source: only point this flag at archives you control or trust.
To load multiple plugins, repeat the flag for each URL:
claude
--plugin-url
https://example.com/my-plugin.zip
--plugin-url
https://example.com/other.zip
Or pass space-separated URLs as one quoted argument:
claude
--plugin-url
"https://example.com/my-plugin.zip https://example.com/other.zip"
​
Debug plugin issues
If your plugin isn’t working as expected:
Check the structure
: Ensure your directories are at the plugin root, not inside
.claude-plugin/
Test components individually
: Check each skill, agent, and hook separately
Use validation and debugging tools
: See
Debugging and development tools
for CLI commands and troubleshooting techniques
​
Share your plugins
When your plugin is ready to share:
Add documentation
: Include a
README.md
with installation and usage instructions
Choose a versioning strategy
: Decide whether to set an explicit
version
or rely on the fallback described in
version management
.
Create or use a marketplace
: Distribute through
plugin marketplaces
for installation
Test with others
: Have team members test the plugin before wider distribution
Once your plugin is in a marketplace, others can install it using the instructions in
Discover and install plugins
. To keep a plugin internal to your team, host the marketplace in a
private repository
.
​
Submit your plugin to the community marketplace
Anthropic maintains two public marketplaces for Claude Code plugins:
claude-plugins-official
: a curated set of plugins maintained by Anthropic. Claude Code registers it automatically the first time you start Claude Code interactively. If you run Claude Code non-interactively before that first interactive launch, or a
marketplace policy
blocked an earlier attempt, register it yourself with
claude plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-official
.
claude-community
: the public community marketplace where third-party submissions land after review. Users add it with
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-community
and install from it as
@claude-community
.
To submit your plugin for community-marketplace review, use one of the in-app forms:
claude.ai
:
claude.ai/admin-settings/directory/submissions/plugins/new
Console
:
platform.claude.com/plugins/submit
The claude.ai form requires a Team or Enterprise organization and directory management access; organization Owners have this access by default. Individual authors who aren’t part of a Team or Enterprise organization can use the Console form instead.
Run
claude plugin validate ./your-plugin
locally before you submit, replacing
./your-plugin
with the path to your plugin directory. The review pipeline runs the same check on every submission, along with automated safety screening. When validation passes, Claude Code prints
✔ Validation passed
, or
✔ Validation passed with warnings
if there are warnings. Warnings don’t fail validation; add
--strict
to treat them as errors.
Approved plugins are pinned to a specific commit SHA in the
anthropics/claude-plugins-community
catalog, and CI bumps the pin automatically as you push new commits to your repository. The public catalog syncs nightly from the review pipeline, so there can be a delay between approval and your plugin appearing in
marketplace.json
. To check whether your plugin is installable yet, search for its name in the
community catalog
.
The official marketplace,
claude-plugins-official
, is curated separately. Anthropic decides which plugins to include at its discretion. There is no application process, and the submission form does not add plugins to the official marketplace.
If Anthropic lists your plugin in the official marketplace, your CLI can prompt Claude Code users to install it. See
Recommend your plugin from your CLI
.
​
Convert existing configurations to plugins
If you already have skills or hooks in your
.claude/
directory, you can convert them into a plugin for easier sharing and distribution.
​
Migration steps
1
Create the plugin structure
Create a new plugin directory in your project root, alongside the existing
.claude/
folder, so the relative
cp
paths in the next step resolve:
mkdir
-p
my-plugin/.claude-plugin
Create the manifest file at
my-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
:
my-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
{
"name"
:
"my-plugin"
,
"description"
:
"Migrated from standalone configuration"
,
"version"
:
"1.0.0"
}
2
Copy your existing files
Copy each configuration directory you have to the plugin root. You might not have all three: if a directory doesn’t exist,
cp
prints
No such file or directory
and copies nothing, so skip that command or ignore the error.
cp
-r
.claude/commands
my-plugin/
cp
-r
.claude/agents
my-plugin/
cp
-r
.claude/skills
my-plugin/
Your plugin now contains copies of the directories you had under
.claude/
. Run
ls my-plugin
to confirm: you should see each directory you copied.
3
Migrate hooks
If you have hooks in your settings, create a hooks directory:
mkdir
my-plugin/hooks
Create
my-plugin/hooks/hooks.json
with your hooks configuration. Copy the
hooks
object from your
.claude/settings.json
or
settings.local.json
, since the format is the same. The command receives hook input as JSON on stdin, so use
jq
to extract the file path:
my-plugin/hooks/hooks.json
{
"hooks"
: {
"PostToolUse"
: [
{
"matcher"
:
"Write|Edit"
,
"hooks"
: [{
"type"
:
"command"
,
"command"
:
"jq -r '.tool_input.file_path' | xargs npm run lint:fix"
}]
}
]
}
}
4
Test your migrated plugin
Load your plugin to verify everything works:
claude
--plugin-dir
./my-plugin
Test each component: run your commands, check that agents appear in
/context
, and trigger the event each hook matches to confirm its effect. Claude Code records which hooks matched and how they exited in the
debug log
.
​
What changes when migrating
Standalone (
.claude/
)
Plugin
Only available in one project
Can be shared via marketplaces
Files in
.claude/commands/
Files in
plugin-name/commands/
Hooks in
settings.json
Hooks in
hooks/hooks.json
Must manually copy to share
Install with
/plugin install
After migrating, remove the original files from
.claude/
to avoid duplicates. Project and user
.claude/agents/
definitions override same-named plugin agents, so the plugin version only takes effect once the originals are removed. Plugin skills are namespaced as
/plugin-name:skill-name
, so the original
/skill-name
and the plugin copy both remain available rather than one overriding the other.

A
plugin
is a self-contained directory of components that extends Claude Code with custom functionality. Plugin components include skills, agents, hooks, MCP servers, LSP servers, and monitors.
​
Plugin components reference
​
Skills
Plugins add skills to Claude Code, creating
/name
shortcuts that you or Claude can invoke.
Location
:
skills/
or
commands/
directory in plugin root, or a single
SKILL.md
file at the plugin root
File format
: Skills are directories with
SKILL.md
; commands are simple markdown files
Skill structure
:
skills/
├── pdf-processor/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   ├── reference.md (optional)
│   └── scripts/ (optional)
└── code-reviewer/
└── SKILL.md
Skills and commands are automatically discovered when the plugin is installed.
If a plugin has no
skills/
directory and no
skills
manifest field, a
SKILL.md
at the plugin root is loaded as a single skill. Set the frontmatter
name
field to control the skill’s invocation name. Without it, Claude Code falls back to the install directory name. For a plugin
copied into the cache
, that name is a version string that changes on every update. For plugins that ship more than one skill, use the
skills/
directory layout shown above.
In plugin skills and commands, Boolean frontmatter fields such as
disable-model-invocation
accept
yes
,
no
,
on
,
off
,
1
, and
0
in any letter case, in addition to
true
and
false
. Before v2.1.218, Claude Code recognized only
true
and
false
.
For complete details, see
Skills
.
​
Agents
Plugins can provide specialized subagents for specific tasks that Claude can invoke automatically when appropriate.
Location
:
agents/
directory in plugin root
File format
: Markdown files describing agent capabilities
Agent structure
:
---
name
:
agent-name
description
:
What this agent specializes in and when Claude should invoke it
model
:
sonnet
effort
:
medium
maxTurns
:
20
disallowedTools
:
Write, Edit
---
Detailed system prompt for the agent describing its role, expertise, and behavior.
Plugin agents support
name
,
description
,
model
,
effort
,
maxTurns
,
tools
,
disallowedTools
,
skills
,
memory
,
background
,
omitClaudeMd
, and
isolation
frontmatter fields. The only valid
isolation
value is
"worktree"
.
For security reasons, plugin-shipped agents don’t support
hooks
,
mcpServers
, or
permissionMode
.
Claude Code loads a plugin agent even when its frontmatter has no
name
or doesn’t parse:
No
name
: Claude Code names the agent after the file, so
agents/reviewer.md
in a plugin named
my-plugin
loads as
my-plugin:reviewer
Frontmatter that doesn’t parse: Claude Code names the agent after the file, uses
Agent from my-plugin plugin
as its description, and ignores every field in the file
By contrast, Claude Code skips a project, user, or managed agent file whose frontmatter has no
name
or doesn’t parse.
To find files in a plugin’s default
agents/
directory whose frontmatter doesn’t parse, run
claude plugin validate
. The path you pass depends on whether the plugin has a manifest, and both examples use
./my-plugin
as the plugin directory:
A plugin with a manifest:
claude plugin validate ./my-plugin
A plugin without a manifest:
claude plugin validate ./my-plugin/agents
. Requires Claude Code v2.1.233 or later.
Agents appear in the
@-mention typeahead
under their scoped name, such as
my-plugin:code-reviewer
, once the plugin is enabled.
For complete details, see
Subagents
.
​
Hooks
Plugins can provide event handlers that respond to Claude Code events automatically.
Location
:
hooks/hooks.json
in plugin root, or inline in plugin.json
Format
: JSON configuration with event matchers and actions
hooks/hooks.json
can carry a top-level
$schema
key that names a JSON Schema URL for editor autocomplete and validation. Claude Code ignores the key at load time.
Hook configuration
:
{
"hooks"
: {
"PostToolUse"
: [
{
"matcher"
:
"Write|Edit"
,
"hooks"
: [
{
"type"
:
"command"
,
"command"
:
"
\"
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
\"
/scripts/format-code.sh"
}
]
}
]
}
}
Plugin hooks respond to the same lifecycle events as
user-defined hooks
:
Event
When it fires
SessionStart
When a session begins or resumes
Setup
When you start Claude Code with
--init-only
, or with
--init
or
--maintenance
in
-p
mode. For one-time preparation in CI or scripts
UserPromptSubmit
When you submit a prompt, before Claude processes it
UserPromptExpansion
When a user-typed command expands into a prompt, before it reaches Claude. Can block the expansion
PreToolUse
Before a tool call executes. Can block it
PermissionRequest
When a tool call needs a permission decision
PermissionDenied
When auto mode denies a tool call, including denials without a classifier verdict. Use JSON
hookSpecificOutput.retry: true
to tell the model it may retry the denied tool call. Claude Code ignores
retry
when the classifier produced no verdict
PostToolUse
After a tool call succeeds
PostToolUseFailure
After a tool call fails
PostToolBatch
After a full batch of parallel tool calls resolves, before the next model call
Notification
When Claude Code sends a notification
MessageDisplay
While assistant message text is displayed
SubagentStart
When a subagent is spawned
SubagentStop
When a subagent finishes
TaskCreated
When a task is being created via
TaskCreate
TaskCompleted
When a task is being marked as completed
Stop
When Claude finishes responding
StopFailure
When the turn ends due to an API error
TeammateIdle
When an
agent team
teammate is about to go idle
InstructionsLoaded
When a CLAUDE.md or
.claude/rules/*.md
file is loaded into context. Fires at session start and when files are lazily loaded during a session
ConfigChange
When a configuration file changes during a session
CwdChanged
When the working directory changes, for example when Claude executes a
cd
command. Useful for reactive environment management with tools like direnv
DirectoryAdded
When a working directory is added mid-session via
/add-dir
or the SDK
register_repo_root
control request
FileChanged
When a watched file changes on disk. The
matcher
field specifies which filenames to watch
WorktreeCreate
When a worktree is being created via
--worktree
,
isolation: "worktree"
, or for a background session. Replaces default git behavior
WorktreeRemove
When a worktree is being removed at session exit, when a subagent finishes, or when you delete a background session
PreCompact
Before context compaction
PostCompact
After context compaction completes
PreModelSwitch
Before Claude Code applies a model switch that you or a client requested. Can block the switch
PostModelSwitch
After the session’s model changes, including changes Claude Code makes on its own, such as restoring the model when you resume a session
Elicitation
When an MCP server requests user input during a tool call
ElicitationResult
After a user responds to an MCP elicitation, before the response is sent back to the server
SessionEnd
When a session terminates
Hook types
:
command
: execute shell commands or scripts
http
: send the event JSON as a POST request to a URL
mcp_tool
: call a tool on a configured
MCP server
prompt
: evaluate a prompt with an LLM (uses
$ARGUMENTS
placeholder for context)
agent
: run an agentic verifier with tools for complex verification tasks
Hooks that target the plugin’s own
bundled MCP server
must use its scoped names. Tool matchers and
if
fields take the scoped tool name
mcp__plugin_<plugin-name>_<server-name>__<tool>
, and an
mcp_tool
hook’s
server
field takes
plugin:<plugin-name>:<server-name>
. A matcher written against the bare server key never fires. See
Match MCP tools
and
Plugin-provided MCP servers
.
​
MCP servers
Plugins can bundle Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to connect Claude Code with external tools and services.
Location
:
.mcp.json
in plugin root, or inline in plugin.json
Format
: Standard MCP server configuration
MCP server configuration
:
{
"mcpServers"
: {
"plugin-database"
: {
"command"
:
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/servers/db-server"
,
"args"
: [
"--config"
,
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config.json"
],
"env"
: {
"DB_PATH"
:
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/data"
}
},
"plugin-api-client"
: {
"command"
:
"npx"
,
"args"
: [
"@company/mcp-server"
,
"--plugin-mode"
]
}
}
}
Integration behavior
:
Plugin MCP servers start automatically when the plugin is enabled
Servers appear as standard MCP tools in Claude’s toolkit
Plugin servers can be configured independently of user MCP servers
If you run
/reload-plugins
mid-session, Claude Code keeps the live connections of servers whose configuration is unchanged
​
LSP servers
Looking to use LSP plugins? Install them from the official marketplace: search for “lsp” in the
/plugin
Discover tab. This section documents how to create LSP plugins for languages not covered by the official marketplace.
Plugins can provide
Language Server Protocol
(LSP) servers to give Claude
real-time code intelligence
while working on your codebase.
Location
:
.lsp.json

env
Environment variables to set when starting the server
initializationOptions
Options passed to the server during initialization
settings
Settings passed via
workspace/didChangeConfiguration
workspaceFolder
Workspace folder path for the server
startupTimeout
Max time to wait for server startup (milliseconds)
shutdownTimeout
Max time to wait for graceful shutdown (milliseconds). When the timeout elapses, Claude Code terminates the server process. When unset, no timeout applies
restartOnCrash
Whether to restart the server after it crashes. Defaults to
true
. Set to
false
to leave a crashed server stopped instead of restarting it
maxRestarts
Maximum number of restart attempts before giving up
diagnostics
Whether to push diagnostics into Claude’s context after edits (default
true
). Set to
false
to keep code navigation but suppress automatic diagnostic injection.
restartOnCrash
and
shutdownTimeout
require Claude Code v2.1.205 or later. Before v2.1.205, the config schema accepted both options but setting either one caused Claude Code to skip that LSP server entirely at startup, with the reason visible only in
claude --debug
output.
Multiple servers for the same extension
: when more than one enabled LSP server declares the same file extension in
extensionToLanguage
, whether the servers come from one plugin or from different plugins, the first server registered handles files with that extension and the others never start. The
/plugin
interface shows a warning naming the plugin whose server is active.
Servers that fail to initialize
: Claude Code skips a server whose configuration is invalid, for example one missing
command
or
extensionToLanguage
, and the other configured servers still start. Run
claude --debug
to see why a server was skipped.
A skipped server doesn’t claim its file extensions, so another valid server that declares the same extension, from the same or a different plugin, still handles those files.
Send log output to stderr, not stdout
: Claude Code reads a server’s stdout as protocol messages only, and accepts message headers up to 64 KiB and a message body up to 32 MiB. Claude Code disconnects a server that exceeds either limit or writes non-protocol output to stdout, and counts the disconnect as a crash for
restartOnCrash
and
maxRestarts
. When you run with
--debug
, Claude Code writes an error naming the cause to the debug log.
You must install the language server binary separately.
LSP plugins configure how Claude Code connects to a language server, but they don’t include the server itself. If you see
Executable not found in $PATH
in the
/plugin
Errors tab, install the required binary for your language.
Available LSP plugins:
Plugin
Language server
Install command
pyright-lsp
Pyright (Python)
pip install pyright
or
npm install -g pyright
typescript-lsp
TypeScript Language Server
npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript
rust-analyzer-lsp
rust-analyzer
See rust-analyzer installation
Install the language server first, then install the plugin from the marketplace.
​
Monitors
Plugins can declare background monitors that Claude Code starts automatically when the plugin is active. Each monitor runs a shell command for the lifetime of the session and delivers every stdout line to Claude as a notification, so Claude can react to log entries, status changes, or polled events without being asked to start the watch itself.
Plugin monitors use the same mechanism as the
Monitor tool
and share its availability constraints. They run only in interactive CLI sessions, run unsandboxed at the same trust level as
hooks
, and are skipped on hosts where the Monitor tool is unavailable.
Location
:
monitors/monitors.json
in the plugin root, or inline in
plugin.json
Format
: JSON array of monitor entries
The following
monitors/monitors.json
watches a deployment status endpoint and a local error log:
[
{
"name"
:
"deploy-status"
,
"command"
:
"
\"
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
\"
/scripts/poll-deploy.sh"
,
"description"
:
"Deployment status changes"
},
{
"name"
:
"error-log"
,
"command"
:
"tail -F ./logs/error.log"
,
"description"
:
"Application error log"
,
"when"
:
"on-skill-invoke:debug"
}
]
To declare monitors inline, set
experimental.monitors
in
plugin.json
to the same array. To load from a non-default path, set
experimental.monitors
to a relative path string such as
"./config/monitors.json"
. Monitors are an
experimental component
.
Required fields:
Field
Description
name
Identifier unique within the plugin. Prevents duplicate processes when the plugin reloads or a skill is invoked again
command
Shell command run as a persistent background process in the session working directory
description
Short summary of what is being watched. Shown in the task panel and in notification summaries
Optional fields:
Field
Description
when
Controls when the monitor starts.
"always"
starts it at session start and on plugin reload, and is the default.
"on-skill-invoke:<skill-name>"
starts it the first time the named skill in this plugin is dispatched
The
command
value supports the
path substitutions
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
,
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}
, and
${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}
, plus any
${ENV_VAR}
from the environment. Prefix the command with
cd "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}" &&
if the script needs to run from the plugin’s own directory.
A monitor
command
can’t reference
${user_config.*}
values. The command runs through a shell, so Claude Code rejects the monitor with an
error
instead of substituting the value. Monitor processes don’t receive
CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_<KEY>
environment variables, so have the monitor script read the value from a config file it owns.
If you disable a plugin mid-session, Claude Code doesn’t stop monitors that are already running; they stop when the session ends.
​
Themes
Plugins can ship color themes that appear in
/theme
alongside the built-in presets and the user’s local themes. A theme is a JSON file in
themes/
with a
base
preset and a sparse
overrides
map of color tokens. Themes are an
experimental component
.
{
"name"
:
"Dracula"
,
"base"
:
"dark"
,
"overrides"
: {
"claude"
:
"#bd93f9"
,
"error"
:
"#ff5555"
,
"success"
:
"#50fa7b"
}
}
When a user selects a plugin theme, Claude Code saves
custom:<plugin-name>:<slug>
in their config. Plugin themes are read-only: when a user presses
Ctrl+E
on one in
/theme
, Claude Code copies it into
~/.claude/themes/
so they can edit the copy.
​
Plugin installation scopes
When you install a plugin, you choose a
scope
that determines where the plugin is available and who else can use it:
Scope
Settings file
Use case
user
~/.claude/settings.json
Personal plugins available across all projects (default)
project
.claude/settings.json
Team plugins shared via version control
local
.claude/settings.local.json
Project-specific plugins, gitignored when Claude Code saves a setting to it
managed
Managed settings
Managed plugins (read-only, update only)
Plugins use the same scope system as other Claude Code configurations. For installation instructions and scope flags, see
Install plugins
. For a complete explanation of scopes, see
Configuration scopes
.
​
Skills-directory plugins
Any folder under a skills directory that contains a
.claude-plugin/plugin.json
manifest is loaded as a plugin named
<name>@skills-dir
on the next session, with no marketplace and no install step. Scaffold one with
plugin init
. Unlike a copied marketplace install, the plugin is discovered in place rather than copied into the plugin cache.
A skills directory tree supports three distinct things:
What you have
What it is
<skills-dir>/foo/SKILL.md
with no manifest
A plain
skill
named
foo
<skills-dir>/foo/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
A plugin
foo@skills-dir
, which can bundle its own skills, agents, hooks, and more
<plugin>/skills/bar/SKILL.md
A skill
bar
packaged inside a plugin
​
Choose where the plugin loads from
Skills directory
Scope
Loads
~/.claude/skills/
personal
In every project, since the location is yours alone
<cwd>/.claude/skills/
project
Only after you accept the workspace
trust dialog
for that folder
A project-scope plugin is checked into the repository and reaches every collaborator who clones it. Because that content comes from the repository rather than from you, it loads only after the same trust gate that governs project allow rules in
.claude/settings.json
, so trusting a parent folder or running with
-p
isn’t enough, and components that run code are restricted further:
MCP servers it declares go through the
same per-server approval
as a project
.mcp.json
LSP servers start only after you trust the workspace
Background monitors
do not load
Personal-scope plugins have none of these restrictions.
Project-scope
@skills-dir
plugins load only from the
.claude/skills/
of the session’s
primary working directory
. They don’t
walk up to the repository root
the way plain skills and commands do, so launching from a subdirectory misses a plugin that lives at the repo root. Launch from the repository root, or
move the session there with
/cd
on v2.1.246 or later.
​
Edit, reload, and disable a skills-directory plugin
Changes you make to a skill’s
SKILL.md
take effect immediately in the current session. Changes to the plugin’s other components, such as
hooks/
,
.mcp.json
,
agents/
, and
output-styles/
, do not. Run
/reload-plugins
or restart Claude Code to pick those up. See
Live change detection
.
To stop loading a skills-directory plugin, delete its folder or disable it by name. There is no
uninstall
step because nothing was installed from a marketplace.
claude

my-tool@skills-dir
​
Plugins synced from claude.ai
Claude Code loads the plugins enabled for your claude.ai account, including plugins your organization turns on for its members, alongside the plugins you install from marketplaces. It downloads each one into
~/.claude/plugins/synced/
and loads it as
<name>@synced
, with no marketplace and no install record. A synced plugin runs with the same trust as a marketplace plugin you installed: its skills, agents, hooks, MCP servers, and LSP servers all load.
Where Claude Code syncs these plugins depends on the session:
In
Cowork
and
cloud sessions
, Claude Code downloads them into the session’s own environment when the session starts. Before v2.1.239, Claude Code loaded these plugins as
<name>@inline
, the identity that
--plugin-dir
plugins use.
In terminal sessions where you sign in with your claude.ai account, Claude Code checks your account once each time it starts, then downloads new and updated plugins and removes the ones that you or your organization turned off, all in the background. Syncing in terminal sessions requires Claude Code v2.1.273 or later.
The launch check runs in the background, so it can finish after your session has started. When it adds, updates, or removes a synced plugin in an interactive session, Claude Code shows
Plugins changed. Run /reload-plugins to activate.
Run
/reload-plugins
to load the change in that session, or leave it for the next time you start Claude Code. If you enable a plugin on claude.ai while a session is running, Claude Code downloads it the next time it starts.
Plugin sync in terminal sessions runs under the same sign-in conditions as
skills synced from claude.ai
. It also needs a sign-in that grants Claude Code access to your account’s plugins.
A sign-in from an earlier version of Claude Code picks up plugin access the next time Claude Code renews that sign-in in the background, within a few hours, or right away if you run
/login
again. Plugin sync starts the next time you start Claude Code after that.
claude plugin list
shows synced plugins under a
Synced from claude.ai
heading, and the
/plugin
Installed
tab lists them with
synced
as their source. Manage a synced plugin by the
<name>@synced
ID that
claude plugin list
prints:
Turn one off
: run
claude plugin disable <name>@synced
, or disable it from the
/plugin
Installed
tab. Claude Code saves the choice as
"<name>@synced": false
in your user-level
enabledPlugins
. To turn the plugin back on, run
claude plugin enable <name>@synced
.
Keep one out everywhere
:
turn the plugin off for your claude.ai account
. To keep it out of one project in every environment, set
"<name>@synced": false
under
enabledPlugins
in that project’s committed
.claude/settings.json
.
Manage the plugin itself on claude.ai
:
claude plugin install
,
update
, and
uninstall
don’t apply to a synced plugin. Claude Code downloads a plugin’s updates at the next sync. To remove one, turn the plugin off for your claude.ai account, and Claude Code removes it at the next sync.
Stop syncing on a machine
: set
syncClaudeAiPlugins
to
false
in your user settings. Claude Code stops downloading, and the next time it starts it moves the plugins it already synced to
~/.claude/plugins/.trash/
and no longer loads them. Your organization can set the same key in
managed settings
, or turn off Skills on claude.ai, which stops plugins from syncing too.
You can’t turn off a plugin that your organization marks as required on claude.ai. Claude Code loads it even if you disabled it earlier, and
claude plugin disable
refuses with
Plugin "<name>@synced" is required by your organization and can't be disabled here. Contact your admin to change it.
In
claude plugin list
, these plugins are marked
required by your org
.
When an enabled plugin from any other source matches a synced plugin’s name, Claude Code loads that plugin and reports the synced copy as not loaded. Other sources include marketplace installs,
skills-directory plugins
,
--plugin-dir
plugins, and plugins built into Claude Code. To use the claude.ai copy instead, disable your own copy. Before v2.1.239, Claude Code loaded the synced copy instead of a same-named marketplace install.
​
Plugin manifest schema
The
.claude-plugin/plugin.json
file defines your plugin’s metadata and configuration.
The manifest is optional. If omitted, Claude Code auto-discovers components in
default locations
and derives the plugin name from the directory name. Use a manifest when you need to provide metadata or custom component paths.

Required fields
If you include a manifest,
name
is the only required field.
Field
Type
Description
Example
name
string
Unique identifier in kebab-case, with no spaces, control characters, or bidirectional-formatting characters. When a
marketplace entry
lists the plugin under a different name, the marketplace entry name is what
enabledPlugins
keys and
/plugin
use
"deployment-tools"
This name is used for namespacing components. For example, in the UI, the
agent
agent-creator
for the plugin with name
plugin-dev
will appear as
plugin-dev:agent-creator
.
​
Unrecognized fields
Claude Code ignores top-level fields it does not recognize. You can keep
metadata from another ecosystem in
plugin.json
and the plugin still loads.
This makes it practical to maintain one manifest that doubles as a VS Code or
Cursor extension manifest, an npm
package.json
, or an MCPB/DXT bundle
manifest.
claude plugin validate
reports unrecognized fields as warnings, not errors.
If a field is one or two characters off from a recognized one, the warning
suggests the likely intended name. A plugin with only unrecognized-field
warnings still passes validation and loads at runtime.
How Claude Code handles a recognized field whose value has the wrong type depends on the field:
Most fields
: the plugin fails to load. For example, a
keywords
value that is a string instead of an array is a load error, and
claude plugin validate
reports it as one.
experimental
and
metadata
: Claude Code ignores a non-object value, and
claude plugin validate
reports a warning.
Pass
--strict
to treat warnings as errors. Use it in CI to catch a misspelled
field name or a field left over from another tool’s manifest before publishing,
even though the plugin would load at runtime.
claude
plugin
validate
./my-plugin
--strict
​
Metadata fields
Field
Type
Description
Example
$schema
string
JSON Schema URL for editor autocomplete and validation. Claude Code ignores this field at load time.
"https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-plugin-manifest.json"
displayName
string
Human-readable name shown in the
/plugin
picker and other UI surfaces. For a marketplace-installed plugin, a
displayName
on the
marketplace entry
takes precedence over this value. When no display name is set in either place, users see
name
. Unlike
name
, may contain spaces and any casing. Not used for namespacing or lookup.
"Deployment Tools"
version
string
Optional. Semantic version. Setting this pins the plugin to that version string, so users only receive updates when you bump it, except for a
command
source
or a plugin
loaded in place
; see
Version management
. If also set in the marketplace entry,
plugin.json
wins. If omitted, the version comes from the next source in

metadata
object
Free-form object for your own data, such as entitlement or catalog fields. Claude Code doesn’t read it, so the values never affect plugin behavior. Claude Code ignores a non-object value, and
claude plugin validate
reports it as a warning. Before v2.1.222, Claude Code treated the key as an
unrecognized field
.
{"catalogId": "cat-123"}
defaultEnabled
boolean
Whether the plugin starts in an enabled state when the user has not set one. Defaults to
true
. See
Default enablement
.
false
​
Default enablement
Set
defaultEnabled: false
in
plugin.json
to ship a plugin that installs disabled. The user turns it on with
claude plugin enable <plugin>
or the
/plugin
interface. Use this for plugins that add cost or scope a user should opt into, such as one that connects to an external service.
defaultEnabled
is the fallback when nothing else has decided the plugin’s state. The user’s setting and a dependency requirement take precedence over it:
The user’s setting
: an entry for the plugin in
enabledPlugins
at any settings scope. Once written, it persists across plugin updates and reinstalls, so changing
defaultEnabled
in a later release does not flip an existing user.
A dependency requirement
: when a plugin is required by another one that is active, Claude Code writes
true
for it at install or enable time. That gives it an explicit setting, so its own default no longer applies. See
Enable or disable a plugin with dependencies
.
The same field can appear in a plugin’s marketplace entry, where it takes precedence over the value in
plugin.json
. See
Optional plugin fields
.

Experimental components
Components under the
experimental
key,
themes
and
monitors
, have a manifest schema that may change between releases while they stabilize. Where you declare them is a separate migration: the top level still works,
claude plugin validate
warns, and a future release will require
experimental.*
.
​
User configuration
The
userConfig
field declares values that Claude Code prompts the user for when the plugin is enabled. Use this instead of requiring users to hand-edit
settings.json
.
{
"userConfig"
: {
"api_endpoint"
: {
"type"
:
"string"
,
"title"
:
"API endpoint"
,
"description"
:
"Your team's API endpoint"
},
"api_token"

,
"title"
:
"API token"
,
"description"

}
}
}
Keys must be valid identifiers. Each option supports these fields:

Bounds for

type
Except
sensitive
fields and
multiple
lists, each field of each enabled plugin also appears as a row in the
/config
panel. The rows require Claude Code v2.1.269 or later.
Each value is available for substitution as
${user_config.KEY}
in MCP and LSP server configs and hook commands. Non-sensitive values can also be substituted in skill and agent content. All values are exported to hook processes as
CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_<KEY>
environment variables, where
<KEY>
is the option key uppercased.
Fields that run in a shell reject
${user_config.*}
: substituting a configured value into a shell command would let the shell run whatever that value contains, so the component fails with an
error
instead. Each rejected field has an alternative way to pass the value:
Rejected field
How to pass the value
Shell-form hook commands
Use
exec form
with
args
, or read
CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_<KEY>
from the hook’s environment
Monitor
commands
Read the value from a config file in the script
MCP
headersHelper
Read the value from a config file in the script
Before v2.1.207, these fields substituted
${user_config.KEY}
values; update plugins that relied on this.
Non-sensitive values are stored under the
pluginConfigs
key in your user
settings.json
as
pluginConfigs[<plugin-id>].options
.
On macOS, Claude Code stores sensitive values in the macOS Keychain, falling back to
~/.claude/.credentials.json
when the Keychain rejects the write. On platforms without a supported keychain, it stores them in
~/.claude/.credentials.json
. Keychain storage is shared with OAuth tokens and has an approximately 2 KB total limit, so keep sensitive values small.
Claude Code reads all
pluginConfigs
values from only three settings sources:
User settings
:
~/.claude/settings.json
, the file the enable-time prompt writes to
--settings
: the CLI flag or SDK inline settings
Managed settings
:
organization-controlled policy
When more than one source sets the same key, managed settings take precedence, then
--settings
, then user settings. The only source you can remove from this list is user settings: pass
--setting-sources
without
user
and Claude Code skips them. Managed settings and
--settings
stay whatever you pass. The SDK’s
settingSources
option sets the same list.
Entries in a project’s
.claude/settings.json
or
.claude/settings.local.json
are ignored. Both files live in the workspace, so a cloned repository could supply values there, and those values would flow into plugin hook commands, MCP server configs, LSP commands, and monitor commands. Before v2.1.207, these entries were read. The restriction is specific to
pluginConfigs
:
enabledPlugins
still honors project and local settings.
​
Channels
The
channels
field lets a plugin declare one or more message channels that inject content into the conversation. Each channel binds to an MCP server that the plugin provides.
{
"channels"
: [
{
"server"
:
"telegram"
,
"userConfig"
: {
"bot_token"
: {
"type"
:
"string"
,
"title"
:
"Bot token"
,
"description"
:
"Telegram bot token"
,
"sensitive"
:
true
},
"owner_id"
: {
"type"
:
"string"
,
"title"
:
"Owner ID"
,
"description"
:
"Your Telegram user ID"
}
}
}
]
}
The
server
field is required and must match a key in the plugin’s
mcpServers
. The optional per-channel
userConfig
uses the same schema as the top-level field, letting the plugin prompt for bot tokens or owner IDs when the plugin is enabled.
​
Path behavior rules
Whether a custom path replaces or extends the plugin’s default directory depends on the field:
Replaces the default
:
commands
,
agents
,
workflows
,
outputStyles
,
experimental.themes
,
experimental.monitors
. For example, when the manifest specifies
commands
, the default
commands/
directory is not scanned. To keep the default and add more, list it explicitly:
"commands": ["./commands/", "./extras/"]
Adds to the default
:
skills
. The default
skills/
directory is always scanned, and directories listed in
skills
are loaded alongside it. Exception: for a
marketplace entry whose
source
resolves to the marketplace root
, declaring specific subdirectories replaces the default
skills/
scan
Own merge rules
:
hooks
,
MCP servers
, and
LSP servers
. See each section for how multiple sources combine
When a plugin has both a default folder and the matching manifest key, Claude Code warns about the ignored folder in
claude plugin list
and the
/plugin
detail view. The plugin still loads using the manifest paths. Claude Code doesn’t warn when the manifest key points into the default folder, for example
"commands": ["./commands/deploy.md"]
, because that path names the folder explicitly.
For all path fields:
All paths must be relative to the plugin root and start with
./
, except that the
skills
field also accepts
"."
Both
"."
and
"./"
denote the plugin root itself
Before v2.1.221,
"."
failed manifest validation and the plugin didn’t load, so use
"./"
to support earlier versions
Components from custom paths use the same naming and namespacing rules
Multiple paths can be specified as arrays
A skill path can point to a directory that contains a
SKILL.md
directly, for example
"skills": ["."]
for the plugin root
Claude Code takes the skill’s invocation name from the frontmatter
name
field in
SKILL.md
, so the name stays stable whatever the install directory is named
If
name
isn’t set in the frontmatter, Claude Code falls back to the directory basename
A plugin that has a
SKILL.md
at its root, no
skills/
subdirectory, and no
skills
manifest field is automatically loaded as a single-skill plugin. You do not need to set
"skills": ["./"]
in
plugin.json
for this layout.
Path examples
:
{
"commands"
: [
"./specialized/deploy.md"
,
"./utilities/batch-process.md"
],
"agents"
: [
"./custom-agents/reviewer.md"
,
"./custom-agents/tester.md"
]
}
​
Environment variables
Claude Code provides three variables for referencing paths:
Variable
Resolves to
Use it for
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
Absolute path to the plugin’s installation directory
Scripts, binaries, and config files bundled with the plugin
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}
Persistent directory
that survives plugin updates, created on first reference
Installed dependencies such as
node_modules
or Python virtual environments, generated code, and caches
${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}
The project root
Project-local scripts and config files
All three are exported as environment variables to hook processes and to MCP and LSP server subprocesses. They aren’t present in the environment of commands Claude runs through the Bash tool, in the main session or in a subagent. In plugin content, write the placeholder instead, and Claude Code substitutes the path inline when it loads the content. Which fields substitute them inline depends on the plugin component:
Plugin component
Fields where placeholders resolve
Skill and agent content
Anywhere the placeholder appears
Hook and monitor commands
Anywhere the placeholder appears
MCP
stdio
servers
command
,
args
,
env
MCP
http
,
sse
,
ws
servers
url
,
headers
,
headersHelper
LSP servers
command
,
args
,
env
,
workspaceFolder
In hook commands, use
exec form
with
args
so each path is passed as one argument with no quoting. In shell-form hooks and monitor commands, wrap the variables in double quotes, as in
"${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/scripts/server.sh"
. This shell-form hook runs a script bundled with a plugin:
{
"hooks"
: {
"PostToolUse"
: [
{
"hooks"
: [
{
"type"
:
"command"
,
"command"
:
"
\"
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
\"
/scripts/process.sh"
}
]
}
]
}
}
For a copied plugin,
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
changes when the plugin updates. The previous version’s directory remains on disk for a grace period after an update, but treat it as ephemeral and don’t write state there. For a plugin loaded in place from a local-directory marketplace, the variable points at the stable source directory. See
plugin caching
for which plugins are copied and for cleanup semantics.
When a copied plugin updates mid-session, hook commands, monitors, MCP servers, and LSP servers keep using the previous version’s path. Run
/reload-plugins
to switch hooks, MCP servers, and LSP servers to the new path; monitors require a session restart. In a session without an interactive terminal, the reload leaves plugin MCP servers on the old path until the next session.
For a plugin with a
command
source, Claude Code
can reload the plugin itself
.
MCP servers can also call the
roots/list
request to read the session’s working directories at runtime. See
what
roots/list
returns and when Claude Code notifies the server of changes
.
​
Persistent data directory
The
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}
directory resolves to
~/.claude/plugins/data/{id}/
, where
{id}
is the plugin identifier with characters outside
a-z
,
A-Z
,
0-9
,
_
, and
-
replaced by
-
. For a plugin installed as
formatter@my-marketplace
, the directory is
~/.claude/plugins/data/formatter-my-marketplace/
.
A common use is installing language dependencies once and reusing them across sessions and plugin updates. Use it for Python dependencies, dependencies locked with Yarn or pnpm, and packages whose lifecycle scripts must run. For a marketplace-installed plugin, you may not need it at all: Claude Code installs eligible
Node.js package dependencies
automatically when it caches the plugin.
Because the data directory outlives any single plugin version, a check for directory existence alone cannot detect when an update changes the plugin’s dependency manifest. The recommended pattern compares the bundled manifest against a copy in the data directory and reinstalls when they differ.
This
SessionStart
hook installs
node_modules
on the first run and again whenever a plugin update includes a changed
package.json
:
{
"hooks"
: {
"SessionStart"
: [
{
"hooks"
: [
{
"type"
:
"command"
,
"command"
:
"diff -q
\"
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/package.json
\"
\"
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/package.json
\"
>/dev/null 2>&1 || (cd
\"
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}
\"
&& cp
\"
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/package.json
\"
. && npm install) || rm -f
\"
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/package.json
\"
"
}
]
}
]
}
}
The
diff
exits nonzero when the stored copy is missing or differs from the bundled one, covering both first run and dependency-changing updates. If
npm install
fails, the trailing
rm
removes the copied manifest so the next session retries.
Scripts bundled in
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
can then run against the persisted
node_modules
:
{
"mcpServers"
: {
"routines"
: {
"command"
:
"node"
,
"args"
: [
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/server.js"
],
"env"
: {
"NODE_PATH"
:
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/node_modules"
}
}
}
}
The data directory is deleted automatically when you uninstall the plugin from the last scope where it is installed. The
/plugin
interface shows the directory size and prompts before deleting. The CLI deletes by default; pass
--keep-data
to preserve it.
​
Plugin caching and file resolution
Plugins are specified in one of three ways:
Through
claude --plugin-dir
or
claude --plugin-url
, for the duration of a session.
Through a marketplace, installed for future sessions.
Through your claude.ai account,
synced
into
~/.claude/plugins/synced/
.
For security and verification purposes, Claude Code copies
marketplace
plugins to the user’s local
plugin cache
(
~/.claude/plugins/cache
), unless the plugin loads in place. A
command
source in link mode
loads in place through links in the cache entry. A
relative path source
in a marketplace added from a local directory loads in place from the marketplace folder.
For a plugin loaded in place from a local-directory marketplace, your edits to the source directory take effect at the next session start or
/reload-plugins
. You don’t need a version bump. The plugin’s hook processes and MCP and LSP servers receive a
CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT
that points at the source directory. Claude Code doesn’t install the plugin’s
Node.js package dependencies
into the source directory. Install them there yourself, or from a hook into the
persistent data directory
.
For copied plugins, each installed version is a separate directory in the cache, grouped by marketplace and plugin and named for the resolved version, with its own copy of the plugin’s files and
Node.js package dependencies
. A dependency resolved from a
release tag
gets a directory name with a commit-SHA suffix.
When you update or uninstall a plugin, Claude Code marks the previous version directory as orphaned and removes it in a background sweep roughly 14 days later. The grace period lets concurrent Claude Code sessions that already loaded the old version keep running without errors. Claude Code runs the sweep only while at least one plugin is installed; after you uninstall your last plugin, orphaned directories stay on disk until you install a plugin again.
Claude Code removes a plugin or marketplace folder from the cache only when it no longer contains any directory or symlink. If you symlink a development checkout into the cache as a plugin’s version entry, Claude Code never marks the link as orphaned and never removes it or the folders that hold it. Claude Code also never writes its version-tracking files inside the linked checkout.
Claude’s Glob and Grep tools skip orphaned version directories during searches, so file results don’t include outdated plugin code.
​
Node.js package dependencies
When Claude Code copies a plugin into the cache, it also installs the plugin’s Node.js package dependencies there, so the plugin’s hooks and MCP servers can load them. This section covers the npm and Bun packages a plugin declares in its own
package.json
. For plugins that depend on other plugins, see
plugin dependency versions
.
Claude Code runs the install inside the copied version directory each time it creates one: when you install a plugin, when Claude Code updates a plugin to a new version, and at session start when an enabled plugin isn’t cached yet, such as on a new machine. The install runs only when the plugin’s root directory contains both a
package.json
and a supported lockfile:
Lockfile
Command
bun.lock
or
bun.lockb
bun install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts
npm-shrinkwrap.json
or
package-lock.json
npm ci --ignore-scripts
If a plugin contains more than one of these lockfiles, Claude Code uses the first match, checking in order:
bun.lock
,
bun.lockb
,
npm-shrinkwrap.json
,
package-lock.json
.
Claude Code skips the install in two cases, each with its own fix:
If your plugin ships only a
yarn.lock
or
pnpm-lock.yaml
, replace it with an npm lockfile.
If a
bunfig.toml
sits beside the bun lockfile, remove the
bunfig.toml
, or replace the bun lockfile with an npm lockfile.
Ship an npm lockfile for the widest reach. Claude Code runs the matched lockfile’s package manager from the user’s PATH and doesn’t fall back to the other lockfile if it’s missing. For a plugin distributed through an npm source, use
npm-shrinkwrap.json
; npm excludes
package-lock.json
from published packages.
Claude Code constrains this dependency install so that no code from the plugin or its packages executes during it, and bounds how long it can run:
Frozen resolution:
Bun and npm install exactly what the lockfile pins, and fail rather than re-resolve versions when
package.json
and the lockfile disagree.
No lifecycle scripts:
--ignore-scripts
keeps
preinstall
,
install
, and
postinstall
scripts from running, so dependencies that build native modules in those scripts download but don’t compile during this install.
60-second timeout:
Claude Code stops an install that runs longer and treats it as failed.
Claude Code fetches an npm-source plugin before this dependency install, and none of the package’s own install scripts run during the fetch. See
npm packages
.
A failed or skipped install never blocks the plugin. When the install fails, or Claude Code skips it because of a yarn or pnpm lockfile or a
bunfig.toml
, it records the reason as a warning in
debug output
. A plugin with a
package.json
and no lockfile is skipped without a log entry. A timed-out install can leave a partial
node_modules
tree in the cached copy.
You can’t turn the automatic install off; no setting or environment variable disables it. In restricted networks, see the
network access requirements
for the hosts to allow.
For dependencies the automatic install can’t provide, such as packages that need their lifecycle scripts to build, Python dependencies, or a plugin locked with Yarn or pnpm, install them from a hook into the
persistent data directory
.
​
Path traversal limitations
Claude Code doesn’t let a plugin reference files outside its own directory. It rejects a component path that resolves outside the plugin root, whether the path is declared in
plugin.json
or in a
marketplace entry
. That covers a path that points outside the plugin as written, such as
../shared-utils
, and a symlink that leads outside the plugin, other than
links within one marketplace

Skip to main content
Output styles change how Claude responds, not what Claude knows. They set Claude’s role, tone, and output format for every response. Use one when you keep re-prompting for the same voice or format every turn, or when you want Claude to act as something other than a software engineer.
A custom output style gives Claude your own instructions and lets you choose whether to keep Claude Code’s built-in software engineering instructions. Keep them when you’re changing how Claude communicates but still coding, like always answering with a diagram. Leave them out when Claude isn’t doing software engineering at all, like a writing assistant or data analyst.
For instructions about your project, conventions, or codebase, use
CLAUDE.md
instead.
​
Built-in output styles
Claude Code’s
Default
output style is its standard set of instructions, designed to help you complete software engineering tasks efficiently.
There are four additional built-in output styles:
Proactive
: Claude executes immediately, makes reasonable assumptions instead of pausing for routine decisions, and prefers action over planning. This is stronger autonomous-execution guidance than
auto mode
applies, and it works without changing your permission mode, so your permission mode still decides what runs without asking you.
Concise
: Claude leads with the result, skips preamble and narration, and keeps responses short by default, while doing the engineering work as thoroughly as in the Default style. When you ask for an explanation or more detail, Claude answers in full. Claude always keeps the complete content of error reports, security warnings, and confirmations for destructive actions. Requires Claude Code v2.1.237 or later.
Explanatory
: Provides educational “Insights” in between helping you complete software engineering tasks. Helps you understand implementation choices and codebase patterns.
Learning
: Collaborative, learn-by-doing mode where Claude will not only share “Insights” while coding, but also ask you to contribute small, strategic pieces of code yourself. Claude Code will add
TODO(human)
markers in your code for you to implement.
​
Change your output style
Pick a style in one of these ways:
/output-style
command
: run
/output-style <style>
to switch, for example
/output-style concise
. With no argument, the command lists the styles you can pick and marks the current one. Claude Code saves your selection to
.claude/settings.local.json
at the
local project level
.
The command also works in
non-interactive mode
and Agent SDK sessions, and from the mobile app or web via
Remote Control
, where you can list and select only
built-in styles
. Requires Claude Code v2.1.269 or later.
Terminal
: run
/config
and select
Output style
to pick a style from a menu. Claude Code saves your selection to
.claude/settings.local.json
at the
local project level
.
VS Code extension
: open the
command menu
with
/
and select
Output styles
to pick a style, including your custom styles. Claude Code saves your selection to
.claude/settings.local.json
, the same file the terminal menu writes. Requires Claude Code v2.1.257 or later.
Desktop app
: set the
outputStyle
field in a settings file, for example
.claude/settings.local.json
, the file the terminal menu writes. When you run
/config
there, Claude Code
opens
Settings > Claude Code
rather than a menu.
To set a style without the menu, edit the
outputStyle
field directly in a settings file:
{
"outputStyle"
:
"Explanatory"
}
When you switch styles mid-session, Claude uses the new style starting with your next message. For what that first message costs in prompt caching, see
Changing output style
. Before v2.1.251, the new style applied only after you ran
/clear
or started a new session.
​
Create a custom output style
A custom output style is a Markdown file: frontmatter for metadata, then the instructions for Claude.
In the VS Code extension, you can also create the file from the
Output styles
menu
rather than writing it by hand. This requires Claude Code v2.1.261 or later.
1
Create a Markdown file
Save it at one of three levels. The file name becomes the style name unless you set
name
in the frontmatter.
User:
~/.claude/output-styles
Project:
.claude/output-styles
Managed policy:
.claude/output-styles
inside the
managed settings directory
Project output styles load from every
.claude/output-styles/
between the working directory and the repository root. When more than one of these nested directories defines a style with the same name, Claude Code uses the one closest to the working directory.
2
Add frontmatter and instructions
Decide whether to keep Claude Code’s software engineering instructions. Set
keep-coding-instructions: true
if you’re changing how Claude communicates but still want it coding the same way. Leave it out if Claude won’t be doing software engineering.
This example leads every explanation with a diagram while keeping Claude’s coding behavior:
---
name
:
Diagrams first
description
:
Lead every explanation with a diagram
keep-coding-instructions
:
true
---
When explaining code, architecture, or data flow, start with a Mermaid diagram showing the structure, then explain in prose.
## Diagram conventions
Use
`flowchart TD`
for control flow and
`sequenceDiagram`
for request paths. Keep diagrams under 15 nodes.
3
Switch to your style
Run
/output-style <style>
in the terminal, or run
/config
and select your style under
Output style
. Claude uses the new style starting with your next message. In the terminal, Claude Code reads style files when it starts, so if you create or edit one during a running session, restart Claude Code to pick up the change.
Plugins
can also ship output styles in an
output-styles/
directory.
​
Frontmatter
Output style files support these frontmatter fields:
Frontmatter
Purpose
Default
name
Name of the output style, if not the file name
Inherits from file name
description
Description of the output style, shown in the
/config
picker
None
keep-coding-instructions
Keep Claude Code’s built-in software engineering instructions
false
force-for-plugin
Plugin output styles only: apply this style automatically whenever the plugin is enabled, without requiring users to select it. Overrides the user’s
outputStyle
setting. If multiple enabled plugins set this, Claude Code uses the first one loaded.
false
​
How output styles work
An output style changes the instructions Claude Code gives Claude.
Claude Code sends the active style’s instructions with every request.
When you
select a style other than Default
, Claude Code also reminds Claude of the style during the conversation.
Custom output styles leave out Claude Code’s built-in software engineering instructions, such as how to scope changes, write comments, and verify work, unless
keep-coding-instructions
is set to
true
.
Output styles apply to the main conversation and to a
fork
, which inherits the parent’s full conversation and system prompt. Other
subagents run their own system prompt
, so styles don’t change how they respond.
Token usage depends on the style. A style’s instructions add input tokens, though prompt caching reduces this cost after the first request in a session.
The built-in Explanatory and Learning styles produce longer responses than Default by design, which increases output tokens. The Concise style does the opposite by instructing Claude to keep responses short by default. For custom styles, output token usage depends on what your instructions tell Claude to produce.
​
Comparisons to related features
Several features customize how Claude Code behaves. Output styles change Claude Code’s default instructions and apply to every response. The others add instructions without changing the defaults, or scope them to a specific task.

Skip to main content
Claude Code has access to a set of built-in tools that help it understand and modify your codebase. The tool names are the exact strings you use in
permission rules
,
subagent tool lists
, and
hook matchers
.
To control which tools Claude can use and when it asks first, configure
permission rules
in your settings,
hooks
, or a
subagent’s tool list
. See
Configure tools with permission rules and hooks
for each place that accepts a tool name.
To add custom tools, connect an
MCP server
. To extend Claude with reusable prompt-based workflows, write a
skill
, which runs through the existing
Skill
tool rather than adding a new tool entry.
On Pro, Max, and Team plans, Claude Code starts sessions in
auto mode
, where a classifier decides most of these prompts instead of you. The
Permission required
column shows whether the tool prompts in
Manual mode
for paths inside the working directory. File-access tools marked No, including
Read
,
Grep
, and
Glob
, still prompt for paths outside the
working directory and additional directories
.
Bash
is marked Yes but runs a built-in set of
read-only commands
without prompting.
Tool
Description
Permission required
Agent
Spawns a
subagent
with its own context window to handle a task. With
agent teams
enabled, a call that carries a
name
can launch a
teammate
instead. See
Agent tool behavior
No
Artifact
Publishes an HTML or Markdown file as an
artifact
: a private, interactive page on claude.ai. You can share it with a public link, or inside your organization on Team and Enterprise plans, where public sharing requires an Owner to
enable it
. Requires a Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise plan and
/login
authentication; see
Availability
Yes
AskUserQuestion
Asks multiple-choice questions to gather requirements or clarify ambiguity. Questions stay open until you answer them by default. See
AskUserQuestion tool behavior
No
Bash
Executes shell commands in your environment. See
Bash tool behavior
Yes
CronCreate
Schedules a recurring or one-shot prompt within the current session. Tasks are session-scoped and restored on
--resume
or
--continue
if unexpired. See
scheduled tasks
No
CronDelete
Cancels a scheduled task by ID
No
CronList
Lists all scheduled tasks in the session
No
Edit
Makes targeted edits to specific files. See
Edit tool behavior
Yes
EndConversation
Ends the session, in rare cases of sustained abusive input or when you ask Claude to demonstrate the tool. Requires Claude Code v2.1.213 or later. See
EndConversation tool behavior
No
EnterPlanMode
Switches to plan mode to design an approach before coding
No
EnterWorktree
Creates an isolated
git worktree
and switches into it. Pass a
path
to switch into an existing worktree instead of creating a new one. On first entry the target may be a worktree of the current repository or, in a multi-repo workspace, of a repository nested inside it. Before v2.1.203, a nested repository’s worktree was rejected. A
path
outside
.claude/worktrees/
prompts for your approval before entering, since it moves the session’s working directory and write access to that location. New-worktree creation and paths under
.claude/worktrees/
don’t prompt. Before v2.1.206, Claude entered paths outside
.claude/worktrees/
without a prompt. From within a worktree session, or from a subagent with a pinned working directory such as
isolation: worktree
, only the
path
form is available and the target must be under
.claude/worktrees/
of the session’s repository
Yes
ExitPlanMode
Presents a plan for approval and exits plan mode
Yes
ExitWorktree
Exits a worktree session and returns to the original directory. Not available to subagents that already run in their own working directory, such as with
isolation: worktree
No
Glob
Finds files based on pattern matching. Absent by default on macOS, Linux, and WSL. See
Glob tool behavior
No
Grep
Searches for patterns in file contents. Absent by default on macOS, Linux, and WSL. See
Grep tool behavior
No
ListAgents
Lists the agents Claude can message with
SendMessage
: subagents in the session,
agent team
teammates, your other local Claude Code sessions, and, while this session is connected to
Remote Control
, your
cloud sessions
and your Remote Control sessions on other machines. Backs the
/list-agents
command. See
cross-session messaging
. Requires Claude Code v2.1.224 or later, and appears only in sessions where
cross-session messaging is enabled
. Teammate rows and the first line showing this session’s own name require v2.1.239 or later
No
ListMcpResourcesTool
Lists resources exposed by connected
MCP servers
No
LSP
Code intelligence via language servers: jump to definitions, find references, report type errors and warnings. See
LSP tool behavior
No
Monitor
Runs a command in the background and feeds each output line back to Claude, so it can react to log entries, file changes, or polled status mid-conversation. Can also open a WebSocket and treat each incoming message as an event. See
Monitor tool
Yes
NotebookEdit
Modifies Jupyter notebook cells. See
NotebookEdit tool behavior
Yes
PowerShell
Executes PowerShell commands natively. See
PowerShell tool
for availability
Yes
PushNotification
Sends a desktop notification, and a phone push when
Remote Control
is connected, so a long-running task or
scheduled task
can reach you when you step away. Push delivery runs through Anthropic-hosted infrastructure, which is not accessible from Amazon Bedrock, Claude Platform on AWS, Google Cloud’s Agent Platform, or Microsoft Foundry
No
Read
Reads the contents of files. See
Read tool behavior
No
ReadMcpResourceTool
Reads a specific MCP resource by URI
No
RemoteTrigger
Creates, updates, runs, and lists
Routines
on claude.ai. Backs the
/schedule
command. The
RemoteTrigger
input reference
documents every action and the organization policies that remove the tool. Routines live on claude.ai and require a Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise plan, so this tool is not accessible from Amazon Bedrock, Claude Platform on AWS, Google Cloud’s Agent Platform, or Microsoft Foundry
No
ReportFindings
Reports code-review findings as a structured list, with a file, summary, and failure scenario per finding, so Claude Code can render them instead of printing them as text. Claude calls it when active code-review instructions tell it to. Requires Claude Code v2.1.196 or later. As of v2.1.199, a finding can also carry an optional
category
slug, such as
correctness
or
test-coverage
, shown next to the file location in the rendered list
No
ScheduleWakeup
Reschedules the next iteration of a
self-paced
/loop
. Claude calls this at the end of each iteration to pick when the next one runs, between one minute and one hour out; you don’t call it directly. To end the loop instead, Claude calls it with
stop: true
, which cancels the pending wakeup. The
stop
field requires Claude Code v2.1.202 or later. The pending wakeup appears in
session_crons
in
Stop hook input
No
SendFeedback
Drafts a feedback report about Claude Code, covering a product problem or Claude’s own behavior in the session, and queues it on your machine for you to review. Claude Code sends nothing until you choose to send the draft. See
SendFeedback tool behavior
. Requires Claude Code v2.1.238 or later
No
SendMessage
Sends a message to another agent: an
agent team
teammate, a
subagent it resumes
by agent ID or name, or one of your other Claude Code sessions, on this machine or beyond it. Messaging other sessions requires Claude Code v2.1.224 or later.
Cross-session messaging
covers which sessions Claude can reach,
what a message looks like when it arrives
, and
how Claude gets a notice when another session goes idle
. Claude can include an optional
summary
input, typically 5-10 words, that Claude Code shows as a one-line preview. When Claude omits it on a
plain-text message
, Claude Code uses the first line of the message as the summary. Claude Code truncates a summary longer than 200 characters with an ellipsis
No
SendUserFile
Sends files from the session to you with an optional caption, so a generated report, diagram, screenshot, or built artifact reaches your device instead of only being mentioned in the transcript. As of v2.1.196, the optional
display
input controls presentation:
render
opens the file inline in the client,
attach
shows a download card only, and when unset the client decides by file type. Available when a
Remote Control
client is connected or in a
cloud session
. Delivery runs through Anthropic-hosted infrastructure, so the tool is not available on Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud’s Agent Platform, or Microsoft Foundry
No
ShareOnboardingGuide
Uploads
ONBOARDING.md
and returns a share link teammates can open in Claude Code. Called from
/team-onboarding
after the guide is written. Available to claude.ai subscribers on Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans
Yes
Skill
Executes a
skill
within the main conversation
Yes
SubagentHandback
Delivers a subagent’s final report to whichever conversation receives that subagent’s result. Provided only in
auto mode
, to subagents that the Agent tool runs locally other than
forks
, and available in the terminal CLI, IDE extensions, cloud sessions, and the Agent SDK; the classifier reviews the report before it’s delivered. Requires Claude Code v2.1.271 or later
No
TaskCreate
Creates a new task in the task list. Provided by default only on the models listed under
Task tool availability
, and on other models when you opt in
No
TaskGet
Retrieves full details for a specific task. Provided by default only on the models listed under
Task tool availability
, and on other models when you opt in
No
TaskList
Lists all tasks with their current status. Provided by default only on the models listed under
Task tool availability
, and on other models when you opt in
No
TaskOutput
Retrieves output from a background task. Deprecated in favor of
Read
on the task’s output file path. When no task matches the ID, the error lists the running background agents by ID and description. Before v2.1.203, the error named only the missing ID
No
TaskStop
Stops a running background task by ID. It also accepts an
agent-team teammate
or a named background agent by agent ID or name. Before v2.1.198, it accepted only a background task ID. When no task matches the ID, the error lists the running background agents by ID and description, including agents that another agent spawned. Before v2.1.203, the error listed running teammates and named agents but not background agents another agent spawned, so those couldn’t be identified or stopped from the main conversation
No
TaskUpdate
Updates task status, dependencies, details, or deletes tasks. Provided by default only on the models listed under
Task tool availability
, and on other models when you opt in
No
TodoWrite
Manages the session task checklist. Disabled by default in favor of
TaskCreate
,
TaskGet
,
TaskList
, and
TaskUpdate
. Set
CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TASKS=0
to re-enable it in
sessions that have the task-tracking tools
No
ToolSearch
Searches for and loads deferred tools when
tool search
is enabled
No
WaitForMcpServers
Waits for one or more
MCP servers
that are still connecting in the background, so a request can use their tools without restarting the session. Claude calls it when a needed server isn’t connected yet. Only appears when
tool search
is disabled, since
ToolSearch
handles the wait when it’s enabled
No
WebFetch
Fetches content from a specified URL. See
WebFetch tool behavior
Yes
WebSearch
Performs web searches. See
WebSearch tool behavior
Yes
Workflow
Runs a
dynamic workflow
: a script that orchestrates many subagents in the background and returns one consolidated result
Yes
Write
Creates or overwrites files. See
Write tool behavior
Yes
​
Configure tools with permission rules and hooks
For the most part, Claude decides when to use these tools and you don’t need to name them yourself when interacting with Claude. You reference tool names directly when defining permissions and other configuration:
in
permissions.allow
and
permissions.deny
in settings, and the
/permissions
interface
in the
--allowedTools
and
--disallowedTools
CLI flags
in the Agent SDK’s
allowedTools
and
disallowedTools
options
in a
skill’s
allowed-tools
frontmatter
in a hook’s
if
condition
All of these accept the same rule format,
ToolName(specifier)
. The specifier depends on the tool, and several tools share a format:
Rule format

No specifier; allow or deny the tool as a whole
Tools not listed here, such as
ExitPlanMode
or
ShareOnboardingGuide
, accept only the bare tool name with no specifier.
An
Edit(...)
allow rule also grants read access to the same path, so you don’t need a matching
Read(...)
rule. A
Read(...)
deny rule also blocks the Edit and Write tools on the same path, including creating a new file there, because both tools change content Claude has to be able to read back. The
Read
deny check requires Claude Code v2.1.208 or later on edits, and v2.1.228 or later on writes.
Hook
matcher
fields use bare tool names, not the parenthesized rule format. See
matcher patterns
for the matching rules. For the field names each tool passes to
tool_input
in hooks, see the
PreToolUse input reference
.
​
Agent tool behavior
The Agent tool spawns a subagent in a separate context window. The subagent works through its task autonomously, then returns its result to the parent conversation. The parent doesn’t see the subagent’s intermediate tool calls or outputs, only that final result. With
agent teams
enabled, a call that carries a
name
can launch a
teammate
instead, which reports back through team messages rather than by returning a result.
To cap how many turns a subagent runs, set
maxTurns
in the
subagent definition
. When the subagent reaches the limit, Claude Code marks the returned result as partial output, and Claude can
resume the subagent
to continue.
The same Agent tool also launches
forked subagents
wherever
fork mode
is on. A fork inherits the full parent conversation instead of starting fresh, runs in the background apart from the
cases that stay in the foreground
, and still surfaces permission prompts in your terminal. The rest of this section describes non-fork subagents.
Which tools a non-fork subagent can use depends on the
tools
and
disallowedTools
fields in the
subagent definition
:
Neither field set
: the subagent inherits every
tool available to subagents
.
tools
only
: the subagent gets only the listed tools.
disallowedTools
only
: the subagent gets every parent tool except the listed ones.
Both set
:
disallowedTools
takes precedence. A tool listed in both is removed.
In every case, the resolved set is limited to the
tools available to subagents
: a tool that isn’t available to subagents is never granted, even when listed in
tools
. Where the conditions in the
SubagentHandback
tools-table entry hold, Claude Code also gives the subagent that tool, even if you leave it out of
tools
or list it in
disallowedTools
.
If every entry in a subagent’s
tools
list fails to match a usable tool, the Agent tool usually returns an error naming the entries instead of launching the subagent; see
Agent would be spawned with zero tools
for the message and how to fix each entry.
Launching the subagent doesn’t itself prompt for permission. Claude Code checks the subagent’s own tool calls against your permission rules as it runs.
Where you see a subagent’s permission prompts depends on whether it runs in the foreground or the background. Claude Code runs subagents in the background by default, apart from the
cases that run in the foreground
.
Foreground subagents
show the same permission prompts you would see in the main conversation, at the moment each tool call happens.
Background subagents
surface permission prompts in your main session as of v2.1.186. The prompt names which subagent is asking, and pressing Esc denies that one tool call without stopping the subagent. Before v2.1.186, background subagents auto-denied any tool call that would otherwise prompt and continued without that tool.
To
limit what a subagent can reach
in the first place, narrow its
tools
field, for example by leaving Bash off the list, or set deny rules in your settings.
​
AskUserQuestion tool behavior
Claude uses
AskUserQuestion
to ask you multiple-choice questions when it needs a decision or a clarification. Answer by picking an option, or type your own text through the
Other
row or the notes field.
When you answer by typing your own text, Claude Code relays the answer with neutral wording so Claude follows what you wrote, including a request to wait or explain first.
​
Question auto-continue timeout
Questions stay open until you answer them. If you want a question you leave unanswered to eventually close and let Claude continue without you, set the
askUserQuestionTimeout
setting to
60s
,
5m
, or
10m
, either in your user
settings.json
or from the
Question auto-continue timeout
row in
/config
.
After a question sits that long with no input, the dialog closes on its own: it submits any options you’d already selected and tells Claude you may be away from your keyboard, so Claude proceeds on its own judgment and can re-ask later. You see a countdown for the last 20 seconds. Press any key to restart the timer; on terminals that report focus, switching to the window restarts it too.
The timeout applies only to
AskUserQuestion
’s multiple-choice questions; permission prompts, including plan approval, never auto-resolve on idle.
​
Bash tool behavior
The Bash tool runs each command in a separate process.
​
What persists between commands
When Claude runs
cd
in the main session, the new working directory carries over to later Bash commands as long as it stays inside the project directory or an
additional working directory
you added with
--add-dir
,
/add-dir
, or
additionalDirectories
in settings. This includes commands Claude runs in response to your later messages.
Subagent sessions never carry over working directory changes.
If
cd
lands outside those directories, Claude Code resets to the project directory and appends
Shell cwd was reset to <dir>
to the tool result.
To disable this carry-over so every Bash command starts in the project directory, set
CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR=1
.
Environment variables don’t persist. An
export
in one command won’t be available in the next.
Aliases and shell functions defined in your shell startup file are available. At session start, Claude Code sources
~/.zshrc
,
~/.bashrc
, or
~/.profile
depending on your shell, captures the resulting aliases, functions, and shell options, and applies them to every Bash command.
Activate your virtualenv or conda environment before launching Claude Code. To make environment variables persist across Bash commands, set
CLAUDE_ENV_FILE
to a shell script before launching Claude Code, or use a
SessionStart hook
to populate it dynamically.
​
Timeout and output limits
Each command runs under a timeout, and Claude manages it: when it wants longer than the default for a command, it passes the
timeout
parameter with that call — you never set a per-command timeout. Two
environment variables
bound what Claude gets:
BASH_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS
— the default when Claude passes no timeout; two minutes out of the box
BASH_MAX_TIMEOUT_MS
— with the default, sets the ceiling that caps whatever Claude requests: the effective ceiling is the larger of the two, ten minutes out of the box
​
Output limits
Claude Code streams a command’s output to a working file as the command runs; a command whose output passes 5 GB is killed. When the command finishes, Claude Code reads the output back from that file, up to the read-back window described below. How much of the output reaches Claude inline depends on whether Claude Code treats the result as a failure:
Result
What Claude gets
Valid
Inline up to roughly 30,000 characters by default; past that, the path of a file saved to the session directory and truncated past 64 MiB, plus a preview of up to the first 2,000 characters, and Claude reads or searches the file when it needs the rest
Failure
Inline up to roughly 10,000 characters; past that, a head-and-tail excerpt of that size cut from the read-back window, with no file path
A command that exits 1 counts as a valid result for the Bash tool only when Claude Code recognizes exit code 1 as a benign outcome for that command:
grep
,
rg
,
egrep
,
fgrep
,
find
,
diff
,
test
, and
[
, plus
git diff
and
git grep
. Every other command that exits 1 counts as a failure, even when exit 1 is a benign informational outcome: no matches for
pgrep
and
jq -e
, files that differ for
cmp
.
BASH_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH
sets how many characters of output Claude Code reads back from the working file into a command’s result: 30,000 by default, up to a hard ceiling of 150,000. Raise it when your commands routinely overflow that window, such as a verbose build or a full test-suite log. Raising it enlarges the read-back window, which is also the window a failing command’s excerpt is cut from. It doesn’t raise the inline ceilings: a valid result over the inline ceiling arrives as a file path plus preview regardless of this variable.
To change how much of a valid result Claude receives inline, set the
bashOutputMaxChars
setting instead, up to 128,000 characters. It sizes the inline ceiling and the read-back window together, and Claude Code then ignores
BASH_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH
. Requires Claude Code v2.1.261 or later.
​
Background commands
For long-running processes such as dev servers or watch builds, Claude can set
run_in_background: true
to start the command as a background task and continue working while it runs. List and stop background tasks with
/tasks
. After you stop one there, or from a connected client such as the desktop app, Claude moves on instead of waiting for it. If a subagent started the command, it’s that subagent that moves on.
A command that a
foreground subagent
started stops when that subagent gives its final response. A command that the main conversation or a background subagent started keeps running after a final response. In non-interactive mode with the
-p
flag,
background commands end shortly after the run’s final result
.
When a command reaches its timeout without finishing, Claude Code moves it to the background instead of stopping it, unless the command starts with
sleep
. Claude keeps working while the command continues. Claude Code applies the same lifetime rules to a moved command as to any other background command, so it still ends a foreground subagent’s command at that subagent’s final response. Setting
CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS=1
disables auto-backgrounding along with the rest of the background task functionality.
The result of a command moved to the background states what happened:
When the timeout triggers the move, the result reports it explicitly:
Command did not complete within its 120s timeout and was moved to the background
, with the seconds matching the timeout that applied, followed by the task ID and the path of the file the output is being written to.
A
cd
,
pushd
,
popd
, or
chdir
inside a command that is moved to the background never carries over: the result states
Session cwd remains <dir>; directory changes made by the backgrounded command do not apply to subsequent commands.
, so Claude doesn’t act on a directory change that didn’t happen.
​
Memory limit on Linux and WSL
On Linux and WSL, set
CLAUDE_CODE_TOOL_MEMORY_LIMIT
to a size such as
4G
to cap the memory that Bash, PowerShell, and
Monitor
tool commands can use, so one runaway build can’t take the memory the rest of the session needs. Requires Claude Code v2.1.233 or later. Before v2.1.246, Monitor tool commands ran outside the cap.
Write the size as a number of bytes or with a
K
,
M
,
G
, or
T
suffix. Set
0
,
off
,
false
,
no
, or
none
to turn the cap off. Claude Code ignores any other value it can’t read as a size, such as
4e9
.
Claude Code counts all of a session’s Bash, PowerShell, and Monitor commands against the one cap, not each command on its own.
Claude Code applies the cap with a memory cgroup. When it can’t set the cgroup up, commands run without a cap, and the debug log from
claude --debug
says why.
After the first process Claude Code starts has turned the cap on, or has turned it off because of an off value or a failed cgroup setup, Claude Code holds that result until you relaunch. To apply a changed or removed value, or a fixed setup, launch
claude
again.
When commands can’t stay under the cap, the kernel kills a command, and nothing in its result names the cap.
Claude Code can also count other kinds of processes it starts against the same limit. Set
CLAUDE_CODE_TOOL_MEMORY_CGROUP_EXCLUDE
to a comma-separated list of the kinds to exempt from the cap; Claude Code applies the cap to every kind not on your list. Set it to
none
to cap every kind, or to
all-new
to cap only Bash, PowerShell, and Monitor tool commands. Requires Claude Code v2.1.246 or later. The kinds you can name:
mcp
: local
MCP servers
lsp
:
language servers
hooks
:
hook
commands
plugin
: commands that
plugins
run
helper
: Claude Code’s own helper commands, such as
git
agent
: child Claude Code processes, such as
agent teammates
Whatever you list, these rules apply:
Unknown names
: Claude Code ignores names it doesn’t recognize
Bash, PowerShell, and Monitor
: Claude Code keeps Bash, PowerShell, and Monitor tool commands under the cap whatever you list
Variable unset
: Claude Code takes the set of other capped kinds from configuration Anthropic delivers from the server, and that set can change over time, so set the variable when you need a set that doesn’t change
Permission-gating hooks
: even with every kind capped, Claude Code excludes from the cap a hook that can block or change the outcome of an action, and any MCP server that such a hook calls, so the kernel killing a permission-gating hook can’t allow the action it was blocking
​
Edit tool behavior
The Edit tool performs exact string replacement. It takes an
old_string
and a
new_string
and replaces the first with the second. It doesn’t use regex or fuzzy matching.
Three checks must pass for an edit to apply. Before any of them, a path matched by a
Read
deny rule
is refused, including creating a new file there. The refusal requires Claude Code v2.1.208 or later.
Read-before-edit
: Claude reads the file in the current conversation before editing it, and a read cut short with a
PARTIAL view
notice
doesn’t count. Claude Opus 4.6, Claude Haiku 4.5, and older models always require the read. Newer models can edit an unread file when reading it wouldn’t need a permission prompt and the Read tool is available.
Match
:
old_string
must appear in the file exactly as written. A single character of whitespace or indentation difference is enough to miss.
Uniqueness
:
old_string
must appear exactly once. When it appears more than once, Claude either supplies a longer string with enough surrounding context to pin down one occurrence, or sets
replace_all: true
to replace them all.
A file that changed on disk after Claude last read it can still be edited when
old_string
matches the current content exactly and unambiguously and Claude Code can read the file without prompting. Matching against the file’s current content keeps this safe, and the result notes that the file carries other changes so Claude re-reads it before edits that depend on surrounding content. In any other case, such as a stale
old_string
or one that matches more than once without
replace_all
, Claude reads the file again before editing. The relaxed handling of unread and changed files requires Claude Code v2.1.208 or later; before that, Claude Code refused any edit to a file it hadn’t read in the conversation or that changed on disk after the read.
Viewing a file with Bash also satisfies the read-before-edit requirement when the command is
cat
,
nl
,
bat
,
batcat
,
head
,
tail
,
sed -n 'X,Yp'
,
grep
,
egrep
,
fgrep
, or
rg
on a single file with no pipes or redirects. Piped output and other Bash commands don’t count toward the read-before-edit check.
Viewing a file with Bash affects edit eligibility only, not permissions. See
Read and Edit permission rules
for which Bash commands your
Read
and
Edit
deny rules cover.
​
EndConversation tool behavior
The EndConversation tool ends the current session. Claude uses it only in two situations:
as a last resort against sustained abusive input, after attempts to redirect the conversation have failed and after a clear warning in an earlier message
when you explicitly ask to see the tool demonstrated and confirm that you want the session to end
General frustration, profanity, or a task going badly don’t qualify, and neither do requests for harmful content, which Claude declines instead of ending the session. Claude Code follows the same approach as claude.ai, which can
end a rare subset of chats
.
After Claude ends an interactive session, the session locks. New prompts and most commands return
Claude ended this conversation. Start a new session (or /clear) to continue.
, and only
/clear
,
/resume
,
/help
,
/exit
, and
/feedback
still run. Claude Code records the end in the session’s transcript, so resuming an ended session restores the lock; the session’s history isn’t deleted.
Resuming an ended session in
non-interactive mode
with the
-p
flag errors and exits with code 1, so a script doesn’t read the ended run as a success.
The tool never prompts for permission, and
PreToolUse hooks
don’t run for it. While any other tool remains, you can’t block it either:
deny and ask rules
naming
EndConversation
have no effect, and neither
--disallowedTools
nor a
--tools
list can remove it. The exemption is deliberate: the tool does nothing except end the conversation, never reading or modifying files or data, and a safeguard of this kind holds only if the session it applies to can’t turn it off. When your deny rules remove every other tool and also match
EndConversation
, as
"*"
does, Claude Code removes it too rather than leaving it as the only tool, unless an allow rule names
EndConversation
explicitly. A deny list that removes every other tool without matching
EndConversation
leaves it in place.
Subagents
never get the tool. Background tasks that share the main conversation’s tool list see it, but calling it there ends nothing.
The tool appears only when all of the following are true:
Version
: Claude Code v2.1.213 or later.
Model
: the session’s model is Claude Opus 4.8, Claude Sonnet 5, Claude Fable 5, or a later version of one of those families.
Surface
: an interactive terminal session, including a
claude
session in an IDE’s integrated terminal, which is how the
JetBrains plugin
runs it. Other surfaces don’t include the tool, such as:
non-interactive
-p
runs
sessions through the
Agent SDK
TypeScript and Python packages
the
VS Code extension
panel, which bundles its own CLI
GitHub Actions
cloud sessions
Startup mode
: not a
--bare
session. Bare mode loads only shell and file tools, so the tool is never registered there.
Provider
: not available on
Amazon Bedrock
,
Claude Platform on AWS
,
Google Cloud’s Agent Platform
, or
Microsoft Foundry
, or on sessions signed in through a
cloud gateway
.
​
Glob tool behavior
The Glob tool finds files by name pattern. On Windows, it’s part of the default tool set. On macOS, Linux, and WSL, Claude Code leaves Glob and
Grep
out of the default tool set, and Claude searches with
find
and
grep
through the Bash tool instead. In Claude’s shell those two commands run embedded versions of
bfs
and
ugrep
, and the searches reach your hooks and permission rules as
Bash
calls.
On macOS, Linux, and WSL, you get the Glob and Grep tools back in these cases:
You name
Glob
or
Grep
in
--tools
or
--allowedTools
when you start the session, or in the equivalent
Agent SDK
options. With
--tools
you get the ones you list, and naming either tool in
--allowedTools
restores both. An allow rule in a settings file doesn’t have this effect.
A permissions
deny rule
, the
--disallowedTools
flag, or
--restricted
removes
Bash
from the session.
A
subagent
lists
Glob
or
Grep
in its
tools
field and leaves out
Bash
. The listed tools come back for that subagent only, or for the whole session when it runs as the main session agent through
--agent
or the
agent
setting.
Glob supports standard glob syntax including
**
for recursive directory matching:
**/*.js
matches all
.js
files at any depth
src/**/*.ts
matches all
.ts
files under
src/
*.{json,yaml}
matches
.json
and
.yaml
files in the current directory
Results are sorted by modification time and capped at 100 files. If the cap is hit, Claude sees a truncation flag in the result and can narrow the pattern.
Glob doesn’t respect
.gitignore
by default, so it finds gitignored files alongside tracked ones. This differs from
Grep
, which skips gitignored files. To make Glob respect
.gitignore
, set
CLAUDE_CODE_GLOB_NO_IGNORE=false
before launching Claude Code.
Claude Code decides permission for a Glob call before it checks whether the search directory exists. It still runs the read-permission check for a missing
path
outside the
working directories
, so a permission prompt for a path doesn’t mean the path exists.
A
pattern
or
path
value that contains a null byte returns an error asking Claude to remove it.
​
Grep tool behavior
The Grep tool searches file contents for patterns. Where
Glob
finds files by name, Grep finds lines inside them. On macOS, Linux, and WSL, Grep is absent by default under the same conditions as Glob. See
Glob tool behavior
for when both tools are available.
Grep is built on
ripgrep
and uses ripgrep’s regex syntax, not POSIX grep. Patterns that include regex metacharacters need escaping. For example, finding
interface{}
in Go code takes the pattern
interface\{\}
.
A pattern, glob, or file type that ripgrep rejects returns an error that includes ripgrep’s diagnostic, so Claude can correct the input and search again. Before v2.1.208, Claude Code reported a rejected input as
No files found
instead of an error, even when the searched-for text existed in the target files.
Three output modes control what comes back:
files_with_matches
: file paths only, no line content. This is the default.
content
: matching lines with file and line number. When the tool’s
offset
parameter points past the last match for a pattern that has matches, Grep returns
No entries at this offset
, so Claude widens or resets the offset instead of concluding the pattern doesn’t match.
count
: match count per file, followed by a total across all matching files. The total covers every match even when the tool’s
head_limit
or
offset
parameters truncate the listed per-file entries. Before v2.1.208, the total only summed the listed entries.
Claude can scope results by file with the
glob
parameter, such as
**/*.tsx
, or by language with the
type
parameter, such as
py
or
rust
. By default, patterns match within a single line. Claude can set
multiline: true
to match across line boundaries.
Grep respects
.gitignore
, so gitignored files are skipped. To search a gitignored file, Claude passes its path directly.
Claude Code decides permission for a Grep call before it checks whether the search
path
exists. It still runs the read-permission check for a missing
path
outside the
working directories
, so a permission prompt for a path doesn’t mean the path exists.
​
LSP tool behavior
The LSP tool gives Claude code intelligence from a running language server. After each file edit, it automatically reports type errors and warnings so Claude can fix issues without a separate build step. Claude can also call it directly to navigate code:
Jump to a symbol’s definition
Find all references to a symbol
Get type information at a position
List symbols in a file
Search for a symbol by name across the workspace
Find implementations of an interface
Trace call hierarchies
Claude Code keeps the tool inactive until you install a
code intelligence plugin
for your language. In
cloud sessions
, Claude Code doesn’t start plugin language servers, so the LSP tool stays inactive there. Claude Code takes the language server’s configuration from the plugin, and you install the server binary yourself.
Claude Code returns an error result for each LSP call on a file whose language server it can’t start.
​
Monitor tool
The Monitor tool lets Claude watch something in the background and react when it changes, without pausing the conversation. Ask Claude to:
Tail a log file and flag errors as they appear
Poll a PR or CI job and report when its status changes
Watch a directory for file changes
Track output from any long-running script you point it at
Connect to a WebSocket feed and report each message as it arrives
For most watches, Claude writes a small script, runs it in the background, and receives each output line as it arrives. For a server that already pushes events, Claude can open a
WebSocket
instead of running a script.
You keep working in the same session and Claude interjects when an event arrives.
Every watch Claude starts has a deadline: 5 minutes by default, at most 30 minutes, and at most 10 minutes in a
non-interactive
run given a single prompt with
-p
.
At the deadline the watch ends. Claude gets one notice, so it can start the watch again if it’s still needed.
Stop a monitor by asking Claude to cancel it or by ending the session. When you stop a
subagent
that started monitors, for example from
/tasks
, those monitors stop with it.
When Monitor runs a command, it uses the same
permission rules as Bash
, so
allow
and
deny
patterns you have set for Bash apply here too. While
auto mode
is active, Claude Code sets aside allow rules that name
Monitor
itself, along with the other
broad allow rules it drops
, so the classifier reviews Monitor commands the same way it reviews Bash commands.
The
WebSocket source
has its own approval prompt, which the classifier also decides in auto mode.
The tool is not available on Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud’s Agent Platform, or Microsoft Foundry. It is also not available when
DISABLE_TELEMETRY
or
CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC
is set.
Plugins can declare monitors that start automatically when the plugin is active, instead of asking Claude to start them. See
plugin monitors
.
​
WebSocket source
The WebSocket source requires Claude Code v2.1.195 or later.
When a server already pushes events over a WebSocket, Claude can connect to it directly instead of writing a polling script. Each kind of socket activity either becomes an event or ends the watch:
Text messages
: each one becomes one event, even when the message spans multiple lines.
Binary messages
: not passed through. Claude receives a placeholder line such as
[binary frame, 512 bytes]
instead.
Messages larger than 1 MiB
: the watch ends, so subscribe to a filtered feed where one exists.
Socket close
: the watch ends and Claude receives the close code.
A WebSocket watch takes a
ws
input in place of
command
, and a single Monitor call can’t combine the two. The
ws
input has two fields:
Field
Required
Description
url
Yes
The endpoint to connect to. Must be a
ws://
or
wss://
URL with no embedded credentials or whitespace, using ASCII characters only
protocols
No
WebSocket subprotocol names to offer during the handshake. Each entry must be a valid subprotocol token, and the list can’t contain duplicates
The
timeout_ms
deadline applies to a WebSocket watch too: the watch ends at the deadline, and
TaskStop
cancels it early.
Opening a WebSocket prompts for approval; in
auto mode
the classifier decides instead. The prompt doesn’t offer an option to skip future prompts for the same host.
Claude Code denies URLs that point at a private, link-local, or cloud-metadata address, including hostnames that resolve to one. It also denies hosts in
sandbox.network.deniedDomains
, and when
allowManagedDomainsOnly
is set in managed settings, any host outside the managed allowlist.
​
NotebookEdit tool behavior
NotebookEdit modifies a Jupyter notebook one cell at a time, targeting cells by their
cell_id
. It doesn’t perform string replacement across the notebook the way
Edit
does on plain files.
Three edit modes control what happens to the target cell:
replace
: overwrite the cell’s source. This is the default.
insert
: add a new cell after the target. With no
cell_id
, the new cell goes at the start of the notebook. Requires
cell_type
set to
code
or
markdown
.
delete
: remove the target cell.
Permission rules use the
Edit(...)
path format. A rule like
Edit(notebooks/**)
covers NotebookEdit calls on files in that directory.
​
PowerShell tool
The PowerShell tool lets Claude run PowerShell commands natively. On Windows, this means commands run in PowerShell instead of routing through Git Bash. How the tool becomes available depends on your platform:
Windows without Git Bash
: the tool is enabled automatically.
Windows with Git Bash installed
: the tool is on by default for claude.ai and Console accounts; set
CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL=1
to enable it in Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud’s Agent Platform, and Microsoft Foundry sessions, or
0
to turn it off.
Linux, macOS, and WSL
: the tool is opt-in.
Your
PreToolUse hooks
receive the tool’s command string in
tool_input.command
, with the same fields as the Bash tool.
Match
Bash|PowerShell
in hooks that inspect shell commands; the
PowerShell hook input section
explains why matching
Bash
alone is not enough.
​
Enable the PowerShell tool
Set
CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL=1
in your environment or in
settings.json
:
{
"env"
: {
"CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL"
:
"1"
}
}
On Windows, set the variable to
0
to turn the tool off. On Linux, macOS, and WSL, the tool requires PowerShell 7 or later: install
pwsh
and ensure it is on your
PATH
.
On Windows, Claude Code auto-detects
pwsh.exe
for PowerShell 7+ with a fallback to
powershell.exe
for PowerShell 5.1. When the tool is enabled, Claude treats PowerShell as the primary shell. The Bash tool remains available for POSIX scripts when Git Bash is installed.
Claude Code spawns PowerShell with
-ExecutionPolicy Bypass
at process scope only, so
.ps1
scripts and module imports work on default Windows installs without changing the machine’s policy. Process-scope bypass doesn’t override Group Policy
MachinePolicy
or
UserPolicy
, so enterprise policies still apply. To respect the machine’s effective execution policy instead, set
CLAUDE_CODE_POWERSHELL_RESPECT_EXECUTION_POLICY=1
.
​
Shell selection in settings, hooks, and skills
Three additional settings control where PowerShell is used:
"defaultShell": "powershell"
in
settings.json
: routes interactive
!
commands through PowerShell. Requires the PowerShell tool to be enabled.
"shell": "powershell"
on individual
command hooks
: runs that hook in PowerShell. Hooks spawn PowerShell directly, so this works regardless of
CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL
.
shell: powershell
in
skill frontmatter
: runs
!`command`
blocks in PowerShell. Requires the PowerShell tool to be enabled.
The same main-session working-directory reset behavior described under the Bash tool section applies to PowerShell commands, including the
CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR
environment variable.
As of v2.1.196, exit code 1 from
grep
,
rg
,
egrep
,
fgrep
,
findstr
, and
git grep
means no matches. Exit code 1 from
git diff
means differences exist. Neither result is reported to Claude as a command failure. For
robocopy
, exit codes 0 through 7 are informational results, such as files copied or extra files detected. Exit codes of 8 or higher count as failures.
​
Windows encoding and exit codes
On Windows, the following PowerShell encoding and exit-code behaviors require Claude Code v2.1.214 or later:
Redirection with
>
and
>>
writes UTF-8 files on PowerShell 5.1
Claude Code encodes text piped to a native command’s standard input as UTF-8
Claude Code captures error output without ANSI escape sequences
A command whose child process waits on standard input receives end-of-file instead of hanging
Exit code 1 from
where.exe
means no match, and from
fc.exe
and
diff.exe
it means the files differ, so when the command produces output, Claude Code treats that exit code as a valid negative answer rather than a command error. Claude Code still reports a silenced form, such as
where.exe /Q
or a redirect to
$null
, as a failure on exit code 1
Before v2.1.214,
>
on PowerShell 5.1 wrote UTF-16LE files, non-ASCII piped input arrived as
?
, and Python scripts could crash with a
UnicodeEncodeError
when printing non-ASCII characters.
​
Preview limitations
The PowerShell tool has the following known limitations during the preview:
PowerShell profiles are not loaded
On Windows, sandboxing is not supported
​
Read tool behavior
The Read tool takes a file path and returns the contents with line numbers. Claude is instructed to always pass absolute paths.
By default, Read returns the file from the start. When a whole-file read exceeds the token limit, Read returns the first page with a
PARTIAL view
notice that tells Claude how much of the file it received and how to read more with
offset
and
limit
. A read that passes an explicit
offset
or
limit
and still exceeds the token limit returns an error.
A read with an explicit
limit
stops as soon as the selected lines exceed what the token limit could ever fit and returns an error without loading the rest of the range. The error tells Claude to use a smaller
limit
, or to search for specific content with
Grep
instead when a single line is that large. Before v2.1.208, Claude Code loaded the whole range into memory before rejecting it, so reading a file with an extremely long single line could run it out of memory.
Reading an empty file returns a notice that the file exists but its contents are empty, and an
offset
past the last line returns a notice giving the file’s line count. Before v2.1.208, reading an empty file returned the past-the-end notice instead.
Read handles several file types beyond plain text:
Images
: PNG, JPG, and other image formats are returned as visual content that Claude can see, not as raw bytes. Claude Code resizes and recompresses large images to fit the model’s image size limits before sending them, so Claude may see a downscaled version of a large screenshot. As of v2.1.196, an image that is still larger than 500KB after that resize is re-encoded as a JPEG at reduced quality with its pixel dimensions unchanged. If Claude misses fine pixel-level detail in a large image, ask it to crop the region of interest first, for example with ImageMagick via Bash.
PDFs
: Claude reads short
.pdf
files whole. For PDFs longer than 10 pages, it reads in ranges with a
pages
parameter, such as
"1-5"
, up to 20 pages at a time.
Jupyter notebooks
:
.ipynb
files return all cells with their outputs, including code, markdown, and visualizations. Claude Code refuses to read a notebook file over 100 MB; the error tells Claude how to read a portion of the notebook instead, such as a slice of cells, with a shell command.
Read only reads files, not directories. Claude lists directory contents with a shell command such as
ls
.
​
SendFeedback tool behavior
Claude-drafted feedback is a feedback report about Claude Code that Claude writes for you. It requires Claude Code v2.1.238 or later. Claude Code saves each draft on your machine under
~/.claude/feedback/drafts/
, and nothing reaches Anthropic until you send it. Claude drafts one with the SendFeedback tool when:
A tool or command keeps failing
It can’t help with something you asked for
You point out a mistake it made, or it notices one
You ask it to file feedback
​
What you see when Claude drafts
After Claude queues a draft, you see a card above your prompt with the draft’s title. Press
1
to review the draft, press
2
twice to send it as written, or press
0
to dismiss it. A dismissed draft stays in your queue. After you dismiss a card, Claude Code asks whether to turn Claude-drafted feedback off. It stops asking once you’ve declined twice.
By default, you see at most three cards in a session; Anthropic can adjust that limit from the server without a release. After the limit, and whenever you set
feedbackDrafts
to
quiet
, you see only a count of queued drafts in the prompt footer.
​
Review and edit a draft
Run
/feedback
with no argument to open your queue. It lists every queued draft from all your sessions, including drafts whose cards you dismissed or never saw. Select a draft to open it for review, where you can:
Edit the title, area, and details
Set
Send transcript
to
yes
or
no
. When the transcript from the session where Claude queued the draft is still available, it starts at
yes
, which sends that conversation to Anthropic;
no
sends the report only
Send the draft, discard it, or leave it in the queue for later
To write a report yourself instead, press
w
for the standard feedback dialog.
/feedback
with text after it, and
/bug
, open that dialog directly.
​
Send a draft
When you send a draft, Claude Code submits it the same way as a
/feedback
report, with the same
retention
, and deletes the draft from your machine. When you send from the card, it shows
✓ Sent
; when you send from the queue, it closes with a receipt ID.
The report carries:
Your title, area, and details
Environment info, such as your Claude Code version, operating system, and model

## Source (changelog): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/claude-code/main/CHANGELOG.md

# Changelog

## 2.1.278

- Changed auto mode for Claude API and Enterprise users, and on Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry and gateways, to default to the server-side classifier, which does not charge for classifier overhead (`CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_MODE_SERVER=0` opts out on Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry and gateways); warns on billed fallback. See https://code.claude.com/docs/en/auto-mode-classifier-billing
- Added an `Auto mode server` row to `/status` showing whether this session's auto mode classifier runs on the server

## 2.1.277

- Added AGENTS.md support: in a project with no CLAUDE.md, Claude Code reads AGENTS.md instead; change it under "Project instructions" in `/config` (not yet on Bedrock, Vertex or Foundry)
- Added `CLAUDE_GATEWAY_PROXY_IS_EGRESS_BOUNDARY=1` for Claude apps gateways whose only egress is a forward proxy: every outbound request hands the proxy the hostname instead of resolving it locally
- Added an optional `headers:` map on Claude apps gateway upstreams, to send static headers to a proxy you run in front of a provider
- Added a line saying a background task's update is waiting when it finishes while a panel such as `/tasks` is open
- Fixed `claude -p` and Agent SDK sessions that could hang with no result after an internal error; they now report the error and exit with code 1
- Fixed conversations failing every request with "text content blocks must be non-empty" when an earlier assistant turn held an empty text block beside other content, including after `--resume`
- Fixed being unexpectedly logged out when an older Claude Code build (for example an IDE extension's bundled CLI) runs on the same machine as the current one
- Fixed interactive start-up hanging or showing an error for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` users when `~/.claude.json` holds a malformed `customApiKeyResponses` value
- Fixed update checks erroring every 30 minutes, and `claude update` hanging when a minimum or maximum version is set, if a proxy returns an invalid version; a malformed `minimumVersion` is now ignored
- Fixed `claude update` on winget- or apk-managed installs reporting "up to date" when the version lookup failed
- Fixed `claude plugin install` sometimes failing and breaking the installed copy when reinstalling a plugin version that a session or another program was using; an unchanged copy is now left alone
- Fixed Grep and Glob reporting no matches when the search could not start because the system was out of processes, memory or file handles; they now return an error saying so
- Fixed the Write tool silently ending the turn as a declined permission when the target path is an existing directory; it now reports a clear error
- Fixed the Edit tool treating an escaped backslash followed by `uXXXX` text as a `\uXXXX` escape, which could make an edit of a non-ASCII character rewrite an escaped backslash sequence instead
- Fixed the Edit tool reporting "Invalid regular expression: regular expression too large" instead of "String not found in file" when a very large edit containing non-ASCII text did not match the file
- Fixed a turn ending early with "Path contains null bytes" when a tool call's file path contained `\u0000` written as an escape sequence; escaped control characters now stay as literal text
- Fixed background sessions (`claude --bg`) exiting when a plugin's LSP server exited or closed its stdin
- Fixed a crash ("Type error") when opening `/mcp` or `/plugin manage` with a malformed `claudeAiMcpEverConnected` value in `~/.claude.json`
- Fixed a crash at launch when `~/.claude.json` holds a malformed `theme` value
- Fixed a crash ("unrecoverable interface error") when the prompt held text containing terminal color codes, for example a prompt recalled from history or text loaded from the external editor
- Fixed a crash when resuming a session whose saved history holds an assistant message stored as a plain string
- Fixed sessions on slow or heavily loaded machines sometimes exiting with "Claude Code exited after an unrecoverable interface error" when the first spinner appeared
- Fixed a rare case where the screen could stop updating for the rest of the session after an internal rendering error
- Fixed a rare case on Windows where a turn could stop with an error such as "Out of memory" right after Claude replied, so that reply's tool calls never ran
- Fixed sessions continued after `/clear` (restart, `--continue`, `--resume`) missing part of their first message when a SessionStart hook printed output, causing a full prompt-cache miss
- Fixed messages from other agents (such as a subagent's SendMessage) that arrived mid-turn showing up below the "Ran N shell commands" row instead of where they arrived
- Fixed the "copied" notice not appearing after drag-selecting text in the fullscreen `/resume` picker and other panels that cover the prompt area
- Fixed `$TMPDIR` expanding empty in Bash commands that run outside the sandbox while sandboxing is enabled
- Fixed WebFetch and WebSearch in Cowork cloud sessions not telling Claude why a request was refused, such as a used-up fetch budget or an admin policy
- Fixed the Claude apps gateway's telemetry relay ignoring a collector hostname or domain listed in `NO_PROXY` when a proxy is set
- Fixed one malformed `strictKnownMarketplaces` or `blockedMarketplaces` entry silently disabling the whole enterprise marketplace policy
- Fixed failed auto-updates leaving large staged downloads behind in `~/.cache/claude/staging`
- Fixed `/plugin` not stripping terminal control characters from messages on the Installed tab, such as the error of a failed plugin update
- Fixed `/plugin` → Installed and `/skills` crashing when a skill or legacy command is named like a built-in Object property such as `constructor` or `toString`
- Fixed `/plugin` closing with no message when every install in a multi-select failed
- Fixed uninstalled plugins reappearing as "failed to load" rows in `/plugin` Installed, and Remove not clearing such a row
- Fixed plugins from the official marketplace being recorded without their commit in `installed_plugins.json`, and `installed_plugins.json` keeping the old commit after updating a pinned-commit plugin
- Fixed plugin reload previews keeping every previewed copy of a plugin archive unpacked until exit, and overwriting the cached `--plugin-url` archive a reload falls back to when its download fails
- Fixed Remote Control session bookkeeping failing when `~/.claude.json` holds a malformed placeholder record
- Fixed the error after a revoked claude.ai login blaming an expired Anthropic profile; it now leads with `/login`
- Fixed typed or pasted text occasionally coming out scrambled in the `claude agents` dispatch input during key repeat or very fast input
- Fixed a crash ("unrecoverable interface error") when resuming a session whose saved transcript contains a stop hook summary without a well-formed hook list
- Fixed Enter on a selected agent panel row doing nothing when `keybindings.json` rebinds Enter in the Chat context, for example to `chat:queueSubmit`
- Fixed PDF page reads on Windows failing when the working folder's path is long (about 120 characters or more)
- Fixed a headless resume (`claude -p --resume`, the SDK, a VS Code extension window reload) starting the session's cost and usage totals at zero; headless sessions now save their totals at exit
- Fixed project skills from the main repository not loading in `--worktree` sessions when `.claude/skills` is untracked
- Fixed a `sandbox.excludedCommands` glob exempting an entire compound Bash command from the sandbox when only one part matched; every part must now match
- Fixed resumed subagents and teammates re-rendering the MCP tool definitions they had loaded, which broke prompt caching for that agent
- Fixed rate-limited artifact publishes telling Claude to stop retrying; Claude is now told nothing was published and when to send the same publish again
- Fixed attachments recorded earlier in a conversation being re-rendered after a resume or relaunch, which dropped extended thinking and missed the prompt cache
- Fixed Console sign-in showing only "Request failed with status code 400" when the server refuses to create an API key; it now shows the server's message
- Fixed messages typed while Claude is still working sometimes being ignored by the model
- Improved session start-up for SDK and headless (`-p`) use: the first turn no longer waits on the per-directory CLAUDE.md lookup
- Improved the Claude apps gateway's loopback error messages to name `CLAUDE_GATEWAY_ALLOW_LOOPBACK`
- Improved `/plugin` Installed: an MCP server listed apart from its plugin now shows which plugin it belongs to
- Improved `claude plugin install` on an already-installed plugin: it now says when the marketplace offers a newer version and names the `claude plugin update` command
- Improved the startup notice overflow line under the logo: it now reads "N more notices hidden" instead of "+N more · /status"
- Improved prompt handling: invisible Unicode formatting and tag characters in a prompt are removed and the cleaned prompt is shown for review before it is sent
- Improved `/ultrareview` when there's nothing to review: messages say which case you're in, offer a command that reviews your latest commit, and a new repository's first commit is reviewed in full
- Improved artifact link handling so Claude reads claude.ai artifact links with the Artifact tool instead of WebFetch when that tool is available
- Improved the dangerous-rm permission prompt to name the flagged rm command and suggest a `${VAR:?}` guard, so headless runs can recover
- Improved the Artifact tool's permission prompts: shorter sentences, pages and artifacts named by title or file name, and links listed after the text
- Changed Fable to always appear in `/model` on the Anthropic API; it is greyed out only when your organization's settings disable it
- Changed the Bash sandbox instructions on Bedrock, Vertex and Foundry to the first-party wording, which frames the sandbox as the boundary of what the task was given
- Changed `/ultrareview` in non-interactive sessions to refuse when the repository has no base branch or shared history
- Changed subagent results to reach the main agent under a header marking them as subagent output, with the result indented, so text in a subagent's result cannot pass as the session's own instructions
- Changed workflow scripts' computed `agent()` prompts on Bedrock, Vertex and Foundry to reach the subagent framed as script-authored text, so the safety classifier does not read them as the user
- Removed the background Haiku auto-title request from `claude -p` runs launched outside an SDK or IDE
- Removed the deprecated TaskOutput tool; Claude reads a background task's output file with Read instead, and the `taskOutputMaxChars` setting and `TASK_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH` no longer have any effect
- [VSCode] Added a Sign out row to the panel menu, with `/logout` in the typed command menu
- [VSCode] Added background shells and other running tasks to the agent map, each with a Stop, and a typed `/tasks` that opens it
- [VSCode] Added a Copy response button on responses and a typed `/copy`
- [VSCode] Added a one-time notice when inactive sessions are archived automatically, and an "Unarchive all" action on the Archived sessions group
- [VSCode] Added the session's cost and token usage to the Account & usage dialog and the session manager where plan limits do not apply (Vertex, Bedrock, Foundry, API key)
- [VSCode] Fixed the "General config" menu row showing `/config` usage text instead of opening settings, and made typed `/mcp`, `/hooks`, `/memory`, `/rewind` and similar commands open their dialogs
- [VSCode] Fixed the effort slider's level not persisting into later sessions on a model that already had a level saved with `/effort`
- [VSCode] Fixed Auto missing from the mode picker for conversations opened in an already-used panel when the saved model setting is a differently-cased alias such as "Sonnet"
- [VSCode] Fixed `/fast` not saving fast mode as the default, so it was lost when the extension relaunched Claude Code
- [Claude Code on the web] Added Personal and Organization sections to the environment picker on Team and Enterprise plans, and admins can now share a personal environment with the organization
- [Claude Code on the web] Changed organization environments to open as a read-only summary from the Code tab on Team and Enterprise plans, with editing under Admin settings → Cloud environments
- [Claude Code on the web] Fixed a cloud environment saved with Custom network access and no domains silently reverting to Trusted; the dialog now asks for at least one domain
- [Claude Code on the web] Changed the admin Claude Code setting labeled "Web" to "Cloud sessions" and removed the redundant read-only Mobile row beneath it
- [Claude Tag] Fixed routines created in a Slack channel on an Enterprise Grid org-wide install failing to read other public channels in their workspace when they ran
- [Claude Tag] Fixed the "Learn more" links on credential presets in Claude Tag access bundles to open each vendor's credential-setup page instead of a generic API reference
- [Claude Tag] Changed the Pylon credential preset in Claude Tag access bundles so admins can point it at Pylon's EU host
- [Claude Tag] Fixed Google Cloud credential forms in Claude Tag access bundles: a refused key file now says why, the website and scopes stay locked, and a rejected rotation keeps the pasted key
- [Claude Tag] Fixed the network events log in Claude Tag admin settings showing no response status for requests through connections that use AWS signing, client certificates or a custom CA

## 2.1.276

- Fixed every request failing with `400 … Input tag 'advisor_20260301'` when `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` points at a proxy or gateway (2.1.275 regression)

## 2.1.275

- Added the signed-in account to Claude apps gateway sign-in: when the gateway names it, you confirm it before the credential is saved, and `/status` shows it
- Added a send-now key (ctrl+enter, or ctrl+x ctrl+s) that interrupts the current turn and sends all queued messages at once; sent and queued messages show in gray until the model receives them
- Added a startup warning when a configured `otelHeadersHelper` fails, so sessions that silently export no telemetry are noticed
- Added syncing of the skills and plugins enabled on your claude.ai account to terminal sessions signed in with it; opt out with `syncClaudeAiSkills: false` or `syncClaudeAiPlugins: false`
- Added `/plugin install
--marketplace
`, which offers to add the marketplace before installing the plugin
- Fixed a restored memory file's age note changing between requests after a compaction or resume, which caused prompt cache misses
- Fixed `--forward-subagent-text` stream-json and SDK output dropping the messages of subagents spawned by a `context: fork` skill, and of forked skills invoked by a subagent or another forked skill
- Fixed @-mention file suggestions being buried below MCP resources when using a custom `fileSuggestion` command or typing `@.`/`@./`
- Fixed fullscreen mode placing background-task completion notices beneath a long turn's collapsed tool row instead of where they arrived; each notice now closes the open row
- Fixed `claude plugin marketplace update` deleting a GitHub marketplace's local copy when the fetch failed and the marketplace was named after its repository
- Fixed plugin and marketplace messages, logs and `claude plugin marketplace list` showing a password or token stored in a git, ssh or marketplace URL
- Fixed a resumed cloud session leaving an unanswered question open in the transcript after a queued message superseded it
- Fixed vim mode placing the cursor one character right after a dot-repeated "!" or a fast-typed "i!" switched a non-empty prompt into shell mode
- Fixed fullscreen mode freezing or blanking for several seconds when scrolling up past a large file diff
- Fixed a stray `
`-style closing tag occasionally appearing in responses
- Fixed plugin messages, logs and the VS Code plugin dialog showing the wrong server for some git addresses
- Fixed a terminal `API Error: 400` on every turn for users behind a network gateway that rewrites API error responses when a beta request header is rejected
- Fixed sandboxed Bash commands on Linux reporting exit code 0 for failed commands when the shell is zsh
- Fixed the Read tool hanging instead of reporting an error when part of a large file could not be decoded under memory pressure
- Fixed `--resume`, the resume picker preview, resumed background agents and the transcript view failing on a session whose saved history contains a malformed task-reminder or @-file attachment entry
- Fixed a crash when resuming a conversation whose transcript contains a malformed message entry, and a fullscreen crash when such a conversation received new messages while scrolled up
- Fixed sessions failing to resume or start when their saved transcript contains a malformed message content block
- Fixed Grep, Glob and @-file suggestions hanging or running out of memory on searches over the 20MB output cap, and system ripgrep reporting "no matches" instead of an error after a flood of warnings
- Fixed `/rewind` in a forked or background session restoring a zero-filled or truncated file when the session's file-history backups could not be fully copied
- Fixed fullscreen sessions sometimes exiting with "Claude Code exited after an unrecoverable interface error" when typing fast or holding a key with the slash-command dropdown open
- Fixed background sessions crashing and restarting their worker when a command fed through stdin ran on a machine that had run out of file descriptors
- Fixed a crash at launch when `~/.claude.json` holds a malformed `mcpNeedsAuthNoticed` value
- Fixed `--resume` and `--continue` dropping a conversation's earlier thinking when a built-in tool it started with has since been switched off by a server-side flag
- Fixed text selected with the mouse in the fullscreen `claude --resume` session picker never reaching the clipboard
- Fixed plugin reload previews replacing a running session's extracted plugin files when the plugin was loaded from a `--plugin-dir` or `--plugin-url` archive
- Fixed self-hosted runners with `--drain-wait-sec` losing the final result of a turn that finished during a SIGTERM drain; the runner now waits briefly for the turn to be reported
- Fixed `SubagentStop` hooks with a specific `matcher` firing for every stopping subagent whose agent type was empty
- Fixed sandboxed Bash commands being unable to write to project directories named `hooks/` or `config/`
- Fixed Artifact updates failing with "File not found" after a session resumes on another machine or its scratchpad is cleared: the page's last published version is restored
- Fixed `/update-config` writing `Write(path)` permission rules, which file permission checks don't match, instead of `Edit(path)` rules
- Fixed four dead documentation URLs (Pricing, Computer Use, Skills, CLI) in the bundled claude-api skill's live-sources table
- Improved prompt caching for a `--system-prompt` that contains a `__SYSTEM_PROMPT_DYNAMIC_BOUNDARY__` line: the text above it is now cached globally, as the SDK's array form already is
- Improved the `/desktop` error when Claude Desktop does not open: it now says why and what to do next
- Improved the Artifact tool's publish and read results: they now say who can open the page and what the owner's Share menu offers
- Improved artifact publish results: they name the tab icon sent, warn when the page contains a NUL byte, and retry a flaky fetch of the newer page to merge after a stale publish
- Improved pasted and attached images: they are now saved where Claude can open them as files without a permission prompt, including in Desktop and VS Code
- Improved the Artifact tool's guidance so Claude updates a shared artifact in place when you were given edit access to it, instead of publishing a separate copy
- Improved plan-usage reads: editor windows and non-interactive sessions on one machine now share a read made in the last minute instead of each calling the usage endpoint
- Improved the `ListPlugins` tool description so Claude knows it lists plugins enabled on your claude.ai account, not plugins installed locally with `/plugin`
- Improved responsiveness when the terminal is slow or paused: output no longer falls further behind while the terminal catches up
- Improved Write and Edit results for files in the synced account-skills folder: they now say the change is not saved to your account and how to save it
- Updated `/logout` for Claude apps gateway sign-ins to also end the session on gateways that advertise token revocation
- Changed hosted sessions to keep an unanswered permission prompt up after a container restart, instead of asking again
- Changed the Artifact tool to ask for a one-word tab icon on a first publish instead of an emoji favicon
- Changed Claude in Chrome in auto mode to skip the extension's per-site check for classifier-approved calls, as bypass mode does, fixing `browser_batch` "Permission denied" after a redirect
- Changed plugins installed from an npm source to be fetched with `npm pack --ignore-scripts` and integrity-verified, so a package's install scripts no longer run
- Changed scheduled and Run now routine runs to save data to, and republish the page of, an artifact you can edit without asking; public artifacts, first publishes and deletes still ask
- Removed the startup notice that told you a one-off scheduled routine had run since your last session
- [VSCode] Added viewing, editing and deleting a saved memory inside the Memory dialog
- [VSCode] Added sending an attached image without typing any text
- [VSCode] Added a Retry link to the MCP servers dialog when the server list fails to load
- [VSCode] Added accept and reject buttons under each change in the proposed-change diff tab, so an edit can be reviewed change by change
- [VSCode] Fixed the transcript creeping toward the bottom in small steps while a permission card waits and content keeps arriving
- [VSCode] Fixed rewound and forked conversations not keeping the permission mode you had picked for the original conversation
- [VSCode] Fixed an empty `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` entry in the `environmentVariables` setting making Claude Code keep its files in the workspace
- [VSCode] Fixed plugin install links opening the Manage plugins dialog for plugin names and marketplace addresses that can't be used in a link
- [VSCode] Fixed Remote Control staying shown as connected after a turn-off that Claude Code reported as failed; it now shows as off
- [VSCode] Fixed the scroll to the bottom on send stopping short of the reply when the reply starts arriving during the scroll
- [VSCode] Fixed the agent map showing agents a crash left unfinished as stopped instead of failed once the session is reopened
- [VSCode] Fixed the "Continuing the step" notice not appearing, and the continue limit resetting, after a reload that follows a crash with background tasks still running
- [VSCode] Fixed the session list showing when a session was last reopened, such as after a window reload, instead of when its last message was sent
- [VSCode] Fixed "Fork conversation from here" failing on the message right after one sent while Claude was working
- [VSCode] Fixed the prompt cache clock showing too few minutes after reopening a session with a message sent while Claude was working
- [VSCode] Fixed a background agent that finished while Claude was running a tool losing its completion notice, and its result on the agent map, after a window reload
- [VSCode] Fixed a rare case where text selected in a git-ignored file could be sent to Claude after the extension was unresponsive for several seconds
- [VSCode] Fixed renaming a running session reverting to the generated name (regression in 2.1.269)
- [VSCode] Fixed some claude.ai/code sessions opening in VS Code as an empty conversation with no messages

- [VSCode] Fixed unreadable code in the plan preview and the Hooks and Permission rules dialogs with the High Contrast Light theme
- [VSCode] Fixed `/remote-control` being ignored while Remote Control is still connecting: running it again now turns Remote Control off immediately

- [VSCode] Fixed the Manage plugins dialog showing a password or token that was typed into a marketplace URL
- [VSCode] Improved the agent map: the pill counts running agents and turns red after a failure, the main agent stays in view while the map scrolls, and agents sort by state then end time
- [VSCode] Changed New session in a Claude editor tab to open in the sidebar when Preferred Location is set to Sidebar, instead of always opening another tab
- [VSCode] Changed a message sent while Claude is working to wait at the bottom of the conversation until Claude starts on it
- [Claude Code on the web] Added a "New routine" button to the page shown when a routine link no longer resolves, next to the link back to your routines list
- [Claude Code on the web] Fixed routine "paused" and "on hold" notifications being cut off mid-sentence; the paused-subscription notice now says to turn the routine back on yourself
- [Claude Code on the web] Fixed cloud environments with a very long allowed-domains list saving fine and then failing every session start; saving now fails up front and says how much to trim
- [Claude Code on the web] Fixed Claude's guidance when a cloud session on a personal account is denied GitHub access: it now links to claude.ai/connect-github instead of an admin settings page
- [Claude Code on the web] Improved what Claude tells you when asked to edit, delete or run a routine it didn't create: it now links to the routine's page so you can do it yourself

- [Claude Tag] Added Amazon CloudWatch, CloudWatch Logs, Amazon SNS, Google Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging presets to an access bundle's Credentials tab in Claude Tag admin settings
- [Claude Tag] Added Datadog presets for the US3, AP1, AP2 and US1-FED sites; new Datadog connections are now limited to Datadog's read and query API routes
- [Claude Tag] Fixed S3 uploads from recent AWS CLI and SDK versions failing with a 502 error when sent through an AWS connection
- [Claude Tag] Fixed Claude treating a channel as inactive, and skipping untagged messages there, while it was still posting in that channel from a routine or a thread

- [Claude Tag] Fixed the model you switched to in a Slack thread silently reverting to the channel's default after that thread's session was restarted or refreshed
- [Claude Tag] Fixed Claude sometimes replying twice when another app or bot @mentioned it in a top-level channel message
- [Claude Tag] Improved Claude's notices in Enterprise Grid channels shared across workspaces: they now say when no workspace is set up yet, or why only organization defaults apply
- [Code Review] Fixed reviews occasionally dropping part of their analysis when one of the reviewing agents returned its findings in an unexpected format
- [Code Review] Fixed pull requests with more than 100 Claude reviews getting a full re-review on every clean merge from the base branch instead of the lighter merge-focused review

## 2.1.274

- Added a visible warning when memory usage is critical, with steps to free memory or restart safely
- Added `CLAUDE_CODE_MCP_STARTUP_WAIT_MS` to bound how long the first non-interactive turn waits for connecting MCP servers (`0` = don't wait)
- Added `effort` attribute to the `claude_code.llm_request` OpenTelemetry trace span, matching the `api_request` event
- Added `claude_code.managed_settings_resolved` OTel event: managed-settings sources and policy helper state; redacted settings and digests with `OTEL_LOG_MANAGED_SETTINGS=1`
- Added `store.connect_timeout_seconds` to the Claude apps gateway config to lengthen the Postgres connect timeout (default 5 seconds), and improved the boot error when the database is unreachable to point to `store.postgres_url` and the configured timeout
- Added `enduser.sub`, the IdP subject, to the telemetry Claude Desktop and Cowork send through a Claude apps gateway
- Added a Claude apps gateway warning when a replica has more requests open than the 256 it sends upstream at once, and a startup log line showing that limit
- Added click-to-expand for collapsed teammate and agent messages in fullscreen mode
- Fixed sessions getting stuck endlessly retrying "unexpected tool_use_id" 400 errors: corrupted transcripts now self-heal where possible, and otherwise a clear error (with a `/rewind` hint) ends the loop
- Fixed MCP servers configured as `http` that only speak legacy HTTP+SSE failing to connect when they answer the first request with 422 or another 4xx error
- Fixed Streamable HTTP MCP tool calls timing out after about 5 minutes even when a longer per-server `timeout` was set
- Fixed MCP prompts and resources not refreshing when a server sends list-changed notifications without declaring `listChanged`
- Fixed MCP tool calls refused with 403 insufficient_scope being reported as an expired sign-in: the error now names the missing permissions and points to `/mcp` re-authentication
- Fixed hook-driven sessions (such as an active `/goal`) ending with "Prompt is too long" instead of compacting when the context overflowed again after a reactive compaction
- Fixed an active `/goal` being lost when resuming (`--continue` / `--resume`) a session that had compacted
- Fixed `claude agents` losing `--model`, `--effort`, `--permission-mode`, `--allow-dangerously-skip-permissions` and `--agent` after an auto-update relaunch
- Fixed a per-turn slowdown when a language server publishes project-wide diagnostics for thousands of files
- Fixed subagents with `model: "opus"` on Bedrock, Vertex or Foundry leaving the session's model when its id has no recognizable model family (unless `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` is set)
- Fixed self-hosted runner sessions failing every turn with a 401 after a few failed token refreshes, until the next scheduled refresh; the runner now keeps retrying, and fetches a new token after a 401
- Fixed clickable links to local file paths doing nothing in VS Code and other terminals that require a `file://` URI
- Fixed the transcript renumbering ordered lists in your own messages (typing "3. 2. 1." displayed "3. 4. 5."); numbers and "N)" markers now show as typed
- Fixed AskUserQuestion preview notes being attached to a previously chosen option instead of the highlighted one
- Fixed AskUserQuestion preview mode dropping the highlighted option when submitting a note with Enter
- Fixed a resumed background agent keeping half of an interrupted tool batch when one of its calls was approved with a message
- Fixed a local `claude -p --resume` started with `CLAUDE_CODE_RESUME_INTERRUPTED_TURN` not reporting background tasks the previous process left unfinished
- Fixed the first turn of a cloud session sometimes starting without the tools of an SDK-hosted MCP server that was still connecting
- Fixed background agent notifications claiming the agent had no live background work when it was still waiting on its own background task and would resume
- Fixed error hints in Claude Desktop sessions to suggest slash commands like `/usage-credits` instead of CLI flags that cannot be used there
- Fixed `/schedule` saving a routine's prompt without its message role when Claude writes the routine in the shape that listing routines returns
- Fixed `/status` not showing the `apiKeyHelper` failure that its own error banner told you to check
- Fixed `/fast on` in non-interactive sessions reporting on and then turning off under an organization's managed fast mode policy; it now says the organization has disabled it
- Fixed the Artifact tool asking you to approve an update to an artifact that it then refused because the session had not read the latest version
- Fixed Cowork and claude.ai cloud sessions with network access on treating reads of a teammate's artifact as if network access were off
- Fixed a plugin or marketplace directory with no git repository of its own taking its version from an enclosing git repository, such as a git-managed `~/.claude`
- Fixed `--strict-mcp-config` with an empty `--mcp-config` holding the first non-interactive turn for up to `MCP_TIMEOUT` on incidental MCP servers
- Fixed Stop prompt hooks re-sending their whole prompt on every block in a conversation; repeat blocks now name the condition with a 500-character label
- Fixed extra empty editor windows opening at startup on Linux under Wayland when running inside the Cursor or VS Code terminal
- Fixed an unhandled promise rejection in the Claude apps gateway when Postgres drops a connection during a spend check
- Fixed Claude apps gateway cutting every open stream on SIGTERM: it now lets in-flight requests finish for up to 25 seconds before exiting (`CLAUDE_GATEWAY_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS`)
- Fixed `installed_plugins.json` being rewritten on nearly every start-up when plugin policy comes from remote managed settings, which made Claude Desktop reload every open session's plugins
- Fixed headless and SDK sessions making a separate model call for every background task that finished; completions already queued are now answered by one call
- Fixed the Bash tool re-sourcing the shell profile (a multi-second stall on the next command) after every plugin reload; it now does so only when the plugins' `bin/` directories changed
- Fixed plugins with a top-level `$schema` in `hooks/hooks.json` showing an "unknown key" notice
- Fixed MCP connection errors and the MCP login tool's description showing secrets resolved from `${VAR}` placeholders in MCP configs
- Fixed Bash permission checks for commands that loop over or assign certain special shell variables; these commands now ask for permission
- Fixed worktree-isolated sessions accepting Bash commands with certain nested shell expansions; these are now refused
- Fixed the Edit permission prompt preview sometimes showing a different location than the approved edit in files with multi-byte characters
- Fixed background commands being stopped after 30 idle minutes on machines under mild memory pressure; they're now stopped only when memory is critically low, and the debug log says why
- Fixed a message a subagent sends to the main session disappearing from the Claude Desktop transcript after a relaunch
- Fixed a plugin loaded from a `.zip` being served from a stale extraction after several overlapping reloads
- Fixed a sub-agent's progress summary being replaced by a runaway multi-paragraph reply
- Improved startup in `--input-format stream-json` sessions: the first turn no longer waits up to 2s for still-connecting MCP servers whose tools tool search defers; they arrive on a later turn
- Improved Monitor tool notifications: a script's final output and its exit now arrive as one notification instead of two, saving a model turn
- Improved Artifact tool errors: when you are not signed in to claude.ai the terminal now says so on the first attempt, and Claude is told to stop retrying a rejected call sooner
- Improved artifact publishing: a publish built on an older version is stopped before it is sent, with the newer page to merge
- Improved safety checks before removing an agent worktree that contains submodule checkouts
- Improved `OTEL_LOG_RAW_API_BODIES=file:
` output: a new `index.jsonl` and `request_body_id` / `message.id` event attributes link each response to its request file and transcript message
- Improved Claude apps gateway boot: it now tries the first Postgres connection up to three times before exiting, so a database that is reachable a few seconds late no longer fails the boot
- Improved the Claude apps gateway's spend-limit check under load: it now takes one database round trip instead of four, so fewer checks time out on a busy gateway
- Improved Claude apps gateway sign-in rate limit errors: `/login` now explains the refusal, and the gateway log says which limit was hit and which setting to change
- Changed Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry and telemetry-disabled installs to use the v2 MCP client and MCP 2026-07-28 negotiation with direct HTTP servers by default, as other installs already do (opt out: `MCP_SDK_GENERATION=v1` or `MCP_PROTOCOL_NEGOTIATION=legacy`)
- Changed `/code-review` to use leaner inline review prompts for every model that has no tuned settings of its own, instead of spawning many review subagents
- Changed `"type": "sdk"` MCP entries in `.mcp.json`, settings, plugins and agent files to be skipped with a warning: only an SDK host application can register in-process servers
- Changed artifact watching in local sessions: a new version published elsewhere no longer starts a turn; Claude learns of it from a later Artifact tool result
- Changed plugin and marketplace clones to leave Git LFS files as pointers instead of downloading them; `git lfs pull` in the checkout fetches them
- Changed self-hosted runners to skip a read-only repository the git host refuses at the access check instead of failing the session start
- Changed the `/status` GitHub line to read "Cloud sessions", and `/web-setup`, `/ultrareview`, and teleport messages to say "cloud session" instead of "Claude Code on the web"
- [VSCode] Added continuation of the step a window reload interrupted, labeled in the chat, with a Claude Code: Continue After Reload setting to turn it off
- [VSCode] Added Memory and Instructions entries to the Customize menu: Memory shows the auto-memory toggles, the saved memories and the memory folders, and Instructions edits the CLAUDE.md files
- [VSCode] Added a `claudeCode.lockEditorGroups` setting to stop Claude from locking the editor groups it opens in
- [VSCode] Fixed a `/btw` side question asked in a new conversation's first seconds occasionally showing another session's side-question history
- [VSCode] Fixed a brief freeze when the extension first looks up your global gitignore file
- [VSCode] Fixed a message sent while Claude was running a tool disappearing from the conversation after a window reload
- [VSCode] Fixed the Manage Plugins enable toggle and MCP servers dialog rows being unreachable from the keyboard
- [VSCode] Fixed sign-ins and sign-outs made in a terminal not showing until a reload after `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` changed in the Environment Variables setting
- [VSCode] Fixed Edit diffs in the chat being cut off at the bottom at some panel widths and for long wrapped lines; diff boxes now fit the rows shown
- [VSCode] Fixed overlapping settings writes from the extension leaving `~/.claude/settings.json` unparseable or dropping a setting
- [VSCode] Fixed Open in New Tab (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Esc) sometimes leaving the new tab's message box unfocused, so typing went nowhere until you clicked it
- [VSCode] Fixed reopening a closed Claude tab splitting the editor layout when its locked group still holds another Claude tab and a file
- [VSCode] Fixed New session opening another locked editor group whenever a file tab shared the group with your Claude tab
- [VSCode] Fixed session names shifting sideways in the session picker while typing a search query
- [VSCode] Fixed the plan review card cutting off its Send feedback button and reason field when a plan has several comments; the comment list now scrolls
- [VSCode] Fixed inline code and code blocks in chat replies being unreadable under the High Contrast themes
- [VSCode] Improved screen reader navigation of the conversation: each message is announced as "You" or "Claude", with the tool name for tool steps
- [VSCode] Changed the default global gitignore file to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is an absolute path
- [Claude Code on the web] Added a "Compare against" branch picker to a cloud session's diff view, so you can diff its changes against any branch instead of only the base branch
- [Claude Code on the web] Fixed git operations in cloud sessions failing with "service unavailable" when GitHub's token renewal briefly errors
- [Claude Code on the web] Fixed editing a routine occasionally making it fire twice or re-enabling a routine that had just been paused
- [Claude Code on the web] Fixed commits in cloud sessions occasionally failing with a signing error for a few minutes after the session's credentials refreshed
- [Claude Code on the web] Fixed the toast after saving a routine whose GitHub trigger couldn't be linked to show the reason, such as a per-repository trigger limit, instead of only "edit to retry"
- [Claude Code on the web] Fixed sessions sometimes flipping back to unread right after you mark them read
- [Claude Code on the web] Changed routines to skip a run and retry for up to 72 hours when the owner's GitHub connection is missing, instead of switching the routine off at the first failed check
- [Claude Code on the web] Changed a routine's on-hold notice: when your subscription is paused it now tells you to turn the routine back on yourself instead of promising an automatic resume
- [Claude Tag] Added a Guests setting to the Add channel and Add workspace forms in Claude Tag admin settings, so owners can pick Inherit, Allow, Channel only or Restrict up front
- [Claude Tag] Fixed Claude not answering when another Slack app or bot @mentions it; the tag now gets a reply and wakes Claude in a channel it had stopped following after days of inactivity
- [Claude Tag] Fixed Claude missing another app's message that tagged @Claude right after a new Slack channel was created; it's now delivered once Claude has joined
- [Claude Tag] Fixed Claude folding a follow-up sent minutes after its last Slack message into it as a silent edit; late updates such as blockers now post as a new reply that notifies
- [Claude Tag] Fixed Claude's Slack search failing with an error whenever it searched within a single channel; it now returns that channel's matching messages
- [Claude Tag] Fixed a safety-filter stop silently resetting a Slack thread's context when nobody was waiting; Claude now always says so and no longer cancels background work still running
- [Claude Tag] Fixed email addresses in Claude's Slack replies rendering with a visible `mailto:` prefix; they now show as the plain, clickable address
- [Claude Tag] Fixed Claude refusing to watch an Enterprise Grid channel shared with the whole organization when asked from another workspace in the grid
- [Claude Tag] Fixed the Environment picker in Claude Tag admin settings showing a raw environment ID instead of the environment's name for archived or app-created environments
- [Claude Tag] Improved Claude's live progress checklist in Slack: capped at 2,000 characters, reposted at most every 15 minutes in busy threads, with older "Latest task list" links updated
- [Claude Tag] Removed the repeated guest-attribution note Claude appended to a Slack canvas each time it edited one in a channel using the "Channel only" guest setting
- [Code Review] Fixed re-reviews occasionally leaving a fixed finding's thread open when the new review also filed a lower-severity note under it
- [Code Review] Fixed rare reviews ending with "Code review encountered an error" when GitHub or an internal service failed transiently at launch; they now wait and retry
- [Code Review] Improved how Code Review words each posted finding: short plain sentences that say who is affected, where the code goes wrong, and the fix up front
- [Code Review] Improved the check-run card and PR comment when a review is skipped because of an organization limit: each cause now links the admin page that fixes it

## 2.1.273

- Added `x-claude-code-request-class`, `x-claude-code-agent-type`, `x-claude-code-prev-tool-durations`, `x-claude-code-compaction` and `x-claude-code-context-compacted` request headers for LLM gateways; opt in with `CLAUDE_CODE_GATEWAY_HINT_HEADERS=1`
- Added a notification when an MCP server disconnects mid-session and automatic reconnection gives up, pointing at `/mcp`
- Added forking a session started with `claude --remote-control` or `/remote-control` from the Claude app; the fork runs as a background session on your computer
- Fixed Bash commands the permission checker cannot fully analyze skipping the prompt under `permissions.blockReadsOutsideWorkingDirectories`, and a subshell hiding a dangerous `rm` in bypass mode
- Fixed skills synced from claude.ai staying available after your organization turns Skills off; they now move to the recoverable trash
- Fixed `allowManagedMcpServersOnly`, `deniedMcpServers` and `disableClaudeAiConnectors` set via MDM or `managed-settings.json` being ignored when server-managed settings are also present
- Fixed 401/403 errors on Bedrock, Vertex and Foundry, and Claude apps gateway 403s, telling you to run `/login`; the message now names the credential to refresh or points to your gateway administrator
- Fixed `/login`, `/upgrade`, and `/extra-usage` discarding earlier thinking from the conversation, which forced a full prompt-cache rewrite on the next request
- Fixed auto mode stopping for approval when the Artifact tool uploads a file you attached to the chat in a cloud or Remote Control session
- Fixed a long-running session recreating a stub `.git/info/exclude` after the repository's `.git` directory was removed or moved away
- Fixed the main prompt dropping a `!` typed at the start while already in shell mode, so negated commands like `! grep …` can be typed
- Fixed Read on macOS refusing a dragged-in screenshot, or any file the system reports under a second path, with "symlink resolution changed after permission was checked"
- Fixed `permissions.blockReadsOutsideWorkingDirectories`: a memory directory chosen by a repository's settings is no longer loaded into the prompt, recalled, indexed, or used by memory extraction
- Fixed sub-agents and background agents being reported as failed, with their result never delivered, when the final streamed reply omitted token usage or carried no model id
- Fixed the context meter and auto-compact counting advisor-tool turns at roughly twice their real context size, which made auto-compact fire at about half the real window
- Fixed `/tui` refusing to restart because of an agent-team teammate that had already finished its work and was no longer shown in the agents panel
- Fixed saved scheduled tasks running in the wrong session after `.claude/scheduled_tasks.json` was copied into another folder, such as a new worktree
- Fixed SDK and `--output-format stream-json` output dropping a subagent's remaining messages and final report after it is moved to the background mid-run (e.g. by `CLAUDE_AUTO_BACKGROUND_TASKS`)
- Fixed `/install-github-app` reporting a SAML single sign-on block as "admin permissions required"
- Fixed Remote Control clients attached to a Claude Desktop, VS Code or JetBrains session being refused when they ask for the session's context window usage
- Fixed the spinner showing a doubled ellipsis ("……") on compaction status lines such as "Running PreCompact hooks…"
- Fixed a false-positive spinner tip suggesting the frontend-design plugin after reading or publishing Artifacts
- Reverted a 2.1.268 change that checked Read and Edit deny rules on Bash lines the permission checker can't analyze (`eval`, `env -C`); commands like `time -p make build` prompt again instead of being denied
- Improved responsiveness in long sessions: hook progress and sub-agent activity no longer re-process the whole conversation on every update
- Improved the Artifact tool's error when a publish includes a file type artifacts don't serve: Claude is told which types are served and what to do instead, and the terminal shows one plain line
- Improved the Artifact tool's page read to state the capabilities and database rules the artifact service holds for the page, for anyone who can publish to it
- Improved artifact database writes: an update can now remove a single field instead of rewriting the whole document
- Improved artifact publishing: a publish whose connection drops after reaching claude.ai is now re-sent safely instead of failing or creating a duplicate version
- Improved the cloud-session GitHub error for an IP allow list, a suspended app installation or SAML single sign-on to show the cause instead of a generic install hint
- Improved `/autofix-pr`: when `gh pr view` fails it now shows gh's own error (sign-in, SAML, rate limit) instead of a generic exit-code line
- Improved `/autofix-pr` to say why GitHub webhook delivery couldn't be set up for the PR (for example, no linked GitHub account) instead of a generic warning
- Improved `/web-setup` errors: a refused GitHub token now lists the likely reasons and the fix, and a connection failure names a configured proxy or TLS certificate problem
- Improved the in-session SSL certificate and proxy connection errors to name the error code and what to fix, such as `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` for an untrusted corporate CA
- Improved the error when a cloud session can't be created because your Claude login expired or was revoked: it now tells you to run `/login`
- Improved the error shown when an MCP server's sign-in expires mid-session to say how to re-authenticate (`/mcp`)
- Changed auto mode on Bedrock, Vertex and Foundry to use the local classifier by default for now; set `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_MODE_SERVER=1` to
