 carries invoked skills forward within a token budget. When the conversation is summarized to free context, Claude Code re-attaches the most recent invocation of each skill after the summary, keeping the first 5,000 tokens of each. Re-attached skills share a combined budget of 25,000 tokens. Claude Code fills this budget starting from the most recently invoked skill, so older skills can be dropped entirely after compaction if you have invoked many in one session.

+Skills extend what Claude can do. Create a
+SKILL.md
+file with instructions, and Claude adds it to its toolkit. Claude uses skills when relevant, or you can invoke one directly with
+/skill-name
+.
+Create a skill when you keep pasting the same instructions, checklist, or multi-step procedure into chat, or when a section of CLAUDE.md has grown into a procedure rather than a fact. Unlike CLAUDE.md content, a skill’s body loads only when it’s used, so long reference material costs almost nothing until you need it.
+For built-in commands like
+/help
+and
+/compact
+, and bundled skills like
+/debug

+Custom commands have been merged into skills.

+control whether you or Claude invokes them
+, and the ability for Claude to load them automatically when relevant.
+Claude Code skills follow the
+Agent Skills
